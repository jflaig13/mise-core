Okay, so this is the payroll for Monday, October 20th, 2025 through Sunday, October 26th, 2025.
Let's see, so we'll start with the Monday AM shift.
Kevin Worley and Brooke Neal were working, Kevin's, there was no bus or utility or anything
like that.
So, each of them, Kevin and Brooke is going to get $129.16, again, each for the Monday
AM shift, Kevin and Brooke are getting $129.16 each.
Okay, now on to Monday PM shift.
These are final numbers.
Austin Kelly made $267.35 in tips, Mike Walton made $267.35 in tips, and then Coban made
$78, and Coban was the utility guy.
And again, those are the final numbers, so I just need to see those numbers represented.

Okay, now on to Tuesday, October 21, Maddox was the utility guy, again, that means he
earns the full 5% of food sales.
So, Brook made $261.04, and that's just reading the report, so we need to take out Maddox's
tip out, which was $43.09, and again, that was Brook Neal who was the bartender, Maddox
was the utility guy, Brook made $261.04, Maddox needs to make $43.09.

Now we will do Tuesday PM shift. These are the final numbers: Austin Kelley made $370.50. Janel also made $370.50. Maddox and Coben each made $45.50 ($91 total tipout).

Okay, now we're on to Wednesday, October 22nd, the AM shift.
It was just John Neal.
Yeah, so there was no support staff in the morning in the AM shift.
John made $138.30.
Again, no tip out.
Okay, wait, the Wednesday morning shift was actually Mark Anbrook.
Still no support staff, we just need to add Mark's tips.
He made $148.62.
Again, that's $148.62.
No tip out.
Okay, and now we're moving on to the Wednesday PM shift.
So typically if Austin Kelly does the checkouts, he writes the final numbers.
So this is an Austin Kelly checkout where it's just the final numbers.
So every number I read you here, I just need to enter that exact number into the person's tips.
Heather Martin made $185.
Janelle Bakke also $185.
Austin Kelly also $185.
There's a three-way tip pool between those three.
And then Coban made $95.15.
And Coban, I guess, was just the utility guy because it was just him.
So $95.15 to Coban.
Okay.
So Thursday, October 23rd, 2025 shift, Austin Kelly worked at Solo and Maddox was his utility guy.
And he didn't do the math for me, so I'm just going to read you the tips.
Read you Austin Kelly's tips, then we need to subtract Maddox's from Austin's ultimately.
So this is before tip out numbers.
Austin's total tips were $379.76.
And 5% of his food sales, which needs to go to Maddox, was $69.42.

All right.
So this is for Thursday, October 23rd, 2025 for the PM shift.
Now we will do Tuesday PM shift. These are the final numbers: Austin Kelley made $268.74. Janel also made $268.74. Maddox made $77.80.


So for Friday, October 24th, 2025, the AM shift, there was no busser and no expo, so it's pretty simple.
Austin Kelly and Kevin Worley each made $228.36.
So to each Austin Kelly and Kevin Worley, we need to give $228.36.
No busser, no expo, no support people at all or utility.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So Friday night is going to be our first tip pool based on hours.
So I don't have final numbers.
We need to figure out the final numbers on this one.
Brooke made $415.93 in tips.
This is before tip pool, before tip out.
Brooke made $415.93.
Kevin made $319.96.
Austin made $212.13.
There was a total of 15.5 hours in the tip pool.
Brooke had six hours.
Kevin had six hours.
Austin Kelly had three and a half hours.
Maddox was our expo.
Coban was our busser.
And Kevin's, let's see, so Kevin's food sales were $677.21.
Brooke's food sales were $1,286.
Austin Kelly's food sales were $631.80.
So Maddox should get the 1% of food tip out.
Coban should get the busser tip out.
Yeah.
Again, just that tip pool based on hours for this one.
This is the first one we've done of this, so I'll check the work.
Make sure to show all the work written out.
I do see here that the total tip out between Maddox and Coban should be about $129.75.
Again, Maddox should, if that total is 5% of food sales, $129.75.
Maddox should get, you know, of the 5%, he should get 1%.
And Coban should get 4%, equaling a total of 5% of food sales.
Okay.
Okay, so this whole one, this is a Kevin report.
Just remember when I say it's a Kevin report, nothing's fucking calculated.
So this is a Kevin report.
So these tip numbers I'm going to give you, it was Kevin Worley and Mark Berianek.
These tip numbers I'm going to give you are before tip out, or excuse me, before tip pooling and before tip out.
So Kevin made $290.61.
Mark made $369.11.
Coban was the utility guy, so he was the expo and busser, so he needs to get 5% of food sales.
That total from Kevin, like his 5% of food sales, would have been $49.73.
Mark made three in tips.
He did $369.11, and his tip out amount was $54.64.


Okay, so, just a reminder for Saturday morning.
Tobin was the utility guy.
Can't remember if I said that or not.


Okay, so Saturday PM shift is another example of a tip pool one
where there's a difference in hours between each employee.
The three front of house servers slash bartenders
that we had on were Kevin Worley, Mark Baryanek,
and Emily Geisler.
Kevin had 5.5 hours, Mark had 5.5 hours,
Emily had 2.5 hours for a total of 13.5 hours in the tip pool.
Kevin made $191.87 in tips,
Emily made $70.94 in tips,
Mark made $128.57 in tips,
and all those are before tip out.
And Maddox was the utility guy.
So Maddox gets 100% of the tip out,
which again is 5% of food sales.
So Mark's tip out, 5% of Mark's sales
would have been $27.40.
5% of Kevin's food sales would have been $16.41.
5% of Emily's food sales would have been $10.50.
So again, we need to, you know,
I need you to calculate all those numbers
and then give me the final numbers on that one.
You know, sometimes I'll give you the food sales
and I need you to calculate the percentage from it.
And other times like, you know, the ones I just read out,
I'll just give you the actual number for the tip out itself.
Okay, now moving on to Sunday, October 25th, 2025.
This is a Kevin report.
So it's not a whole lot of help.
It was Kevin Worley and Mark Buryanek
as my server slash bartenders.
Cobin Cross was my utility guy.
So his total tip out was $10.50.
So that's $10.50.
That's my utility guy.
So his total tip out that he needs to get is $50.12.
And so before tip out,
Kevin and Mark were each supposed to have made $181.81.
So we need to subtract an equal amount of tip out
from each Kevin and Mark's tips,
which would be $181.81.
You need to subtract an equal amount
of the $50.12 from each one.
Okay, now we're doing Sunday PM.
Okay, now we're doing Sunday PM.
Same thing, it's a Kevin report.
So I'm going to give you the tip amount
that each bartender made, again, before tip out.
So Kevin and Mark,
before tip out, after pulling tips,
would have made $186.41 each,
Kevin Worley and Mark Buryanek.
Excuse me, that's not true.
If you add Kevin and Mark's total tips,
it adds up to $186.41.
Divide that by two, so each Kevin and Mark
should have been receiving $93.20.
But then we need to tip out Coban Cross,
who was the utility guy,
and his total tip out should be $29.16.
So we just need to divide that by two
and then subtract that from $93.20
to get each bartender slash servers
final tips for the Sunday PM shift.
