00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So no tip out.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Her final tips for the Monday AM shift are $128.23.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Again, those are final numbers for Monday AM.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now on to Monday PM shift.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is his before tip out number.

Brooke was solo.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So these are the final tip numbers.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And these are the before tip out numbers.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So before tip out, Austin made $116.62.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $16.99.

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now on to Thursday, December 11th, 2025.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is the AM shift.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It was Austin Kelly solo.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So these are the final after tip out numbers.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
$140.02 after final numbers.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
On to Thursday, December 11th, 2025 PM shift.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was Austin Kelly.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
These are before tip out numbers because Ryan was the utility guy.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So before tip out, Austin Kelly made $104.17.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $16.49.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now on to Friday, December 12th, 2025.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Before tip out on Friday, December 12th, 2025 AM shift.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Austin Kelly before tip out made $221.88.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $18.93.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And for the PM shift, it was, let's see, so servers.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And these are before tip out numbers.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So we need to do the calculation like with the other before tip out ones.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Austin Kelly before tip out $414.78 needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $49.34.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Kevin Worley before tip out $156.84.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And he needs to tip out $17.99.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This was a tip pool, so Austin and Kevin need to make an equivalent number of tips after tip out.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now on to Saturday, December 13th, 2025.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the AM shift.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And Kevin and Austin were tip pooling.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
First I'll do Kevin. And again, so these are the before tip out numbers.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we need to do the calculation for that.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And remember, again, Kevin and Austin are tip pooling here.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Kevin Worley total tips and fees before tip out $151.80 needs to tip out Ryan $24.74.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Austin Kelly $227.11 needs to tip out Ryan $40.55.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then Kevin also did a mid shift here.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And this is, there's no tip out here.

61
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So this is the final numbers.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
$122.72. And this was for Kevin's mid shift.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So we can just add these numbers to the PM.

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But these numbers, that $122.72, again, that's a final number.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And it's not tip pooling. Kevin is keeping all of that.

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now on to Saturday, December 13th, 2025.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is the PM shift.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Here are the final after tip out numbers.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Actually, wait, never mind. These are before tip out numbers.

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So we need to do this calculation.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But they were tip pooling. So it needs to be equal.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And when I say they are tip pooling, I'm only referring to the front of house employees.

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mark's tips before tip out were $149.09.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $25.89.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Kevin Worley before tip out made $125.

76
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $13.56.

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Again, Mark and Kevin were tip pooling there.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We need to keep that in mind when doing the calculation.

79
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now on to Sunday, December 14th, 2025.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
These are the final numbers. Mark Baryanek $115.31.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mike Walton $115.31.

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ryan Alexander $17.22.

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Again, those were just the final numbers for that day.

84
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Excuse me, for the AM shift, not for the day as a whole.

85
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Just for the Sunday AM shift.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now for the Sunday PM shift.

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Here are the final numbers. Mark Baryanek $142.00.

88
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ryan Alexander $25.65.
