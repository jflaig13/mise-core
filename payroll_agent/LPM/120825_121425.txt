Austin Kelly $227.11 needs to tip out Ryan $40.55.
Then Kevin also did a mid shift here.
And this is, there's no tip out here.
So this is the final numbers.
$122.72. And this was for Kevin's mid shift.
So we can just add these numbers to the PM.
But these numbers, that $122.72, again, that's a final number.
And it's not tip pooling. Kevin is keeping all of that.
Now on to Saturday, December 13th, 2025.
This is the PM shift.
Here are the final after tip out numbers.
Actually, wait, never mind. These are before tip out numbers.
So we need to do this calculation.
But they were tip pooling. So it needs to be equal.
