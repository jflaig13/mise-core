00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,920
food sales that day was Jamison and that tip-out was calculated as 60 bucks so

8
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:23,440

12
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,400

13
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,880
this is Thursday October 16th 2025 and again these are the final numbers so

14
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:40,960

20
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:49,200

21
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:57,880
O-B as in boy E-N Coben cross and it's a tip pool between Mike and Austin all

22
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,080
these other days I've been tip pools too by the way so they tip pool you know

23
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,760
I'd say 90% of the time and I want to start doing this for all of you know for

24
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:18,120
a lot more things I want to use this as a way to just kind of like talk and you

25
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:27,400
know see it reflected through productivity on AI would be sick okay so

26
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,360
again Friday morning the a.m. shift on October 17th 2025 Mike Walton and Austin

27
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Kelly were tip pooling tipping out Coben excuse me Coben Mike had a hundred and

28
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,880
twenty dollars and seven cents in fees or excuse me no he had a hundred and

29
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:06,280
twenty dollars and seven cents in total tips the tip out to Coben would have

30
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:18,200
been $22.30 and on this day he was making five percent because he was making five

31
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:30,360
percent because he was expo and Buster also known as a utility guy so that was

32
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:38,840
Mike's tips again Coben was getting tipped out but I just gave you Mike's

33
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:49,520
report now we're moving on to Austin Kelly's report total tips were $95 total

34
00:07:49,520 --> 00:08:00,160
tip out was $19.69 and he and Mike are just going to be splitting that tip out

35
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:21,920
Friday night the servers were Janelle Austin Kelly and it's Janelle back again

36
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:51,200
and Mike Walton Janelle did $494.92 in tips her tip out would have been $64.25

37
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:59,640
to the Buster which is four percent of food and $16.06 to the expo which is one

38
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,400
percent of food for a total of $80.31 I'm not sure who the Buster was on Friday

39
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:15,040
October 17th for the p.m. shift so I'm gonna have to figure that out but that's

40
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:25,360
did in tips and what her tip out should have been Austin Kelly's tips $480.58 total excuse

41
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:40,800
me so the Buster tip out was $35.69 expo was $8.92 for a total of $44.61 Mike Walton's

42
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:52,880
total tips were $322.99 the tip out so again so these total tips that I'm saying for all these

43
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,880
reports every single one I ever tell you when I'm like the total tips on their report those are all

44
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:07,440
before tip out so so you know tip out needs to be subtracted from those numbers so you know in this

45
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:19,680
case his total tips were $322.99 and then we have to you know we would have or we need to subtract

46
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,120
or we need to pull their tip out but what the tip out would be for if they weren't pulling for Mike

47
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:36,320
in this case to the Buster which is four percent of food would be $43.46 expo which is one percent

48
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,160
of food would be $10.86 for a total of $54.32 for a tip out

49
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:19,040
uh October 18th Saturday this is the AM shift

50
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:31,680
uh Coban was the Buster and expo he um and then so look so these tips for the servers

51
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:45,520
these are going to be after tip out so Janelle $299.98 Mark $299.98 so

52
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,360
uh

53
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:06,240
so yeah so earlier when I said something about that uh the tips on all the reports

54
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:20,880
uh so when I read each individual server's tips and then I read their tip out that means that I'm

55
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:29,760
reading it from their actual like toast report toast rpos and so that means that those need to

56
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:38,160
be calculated like I need to figure out the the you know total tips after tip out and after pulling

57
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:48,880
for those days but like for example for this one for October 18th which was Saturday morning

58
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
yeah Saturday morning

59
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,520
they wrote a little thing for me so they wrote a note for me and sometimes they'll do that

60
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,680
and so this just is their final thing and I wish they would do this more often but

61
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:17,280
so we have the final one today Janelle Bakke made $299.98 and Mark also made $299.98

62
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
Coban was the Buster he made $111.45

63
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:30,320
so that one is just on a silver platter um Saturday night

64
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,000
Coban and Maddox um are going to split $131.11

65
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,240
um and then so these again are after tip out

66
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,400
it's Mark Buryanek and Buryanek is spelled B as in boy U-R-Y-A-N-E-K

67
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,720
um Janelle Bakke again B as in boy A-K as in kangaroo I

68
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,640
and Heather Martin

69
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,680
so Mark so each one of those servers there's three of them again would have made $243.70

70
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:34,240
so now on Sunday October 19th in the morning Kevin

71
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:46,560
Worley and Mike Walton were the two servers they did not tip pool Coban was the expo slash Buster

72
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,560
um

73
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:08,880
and Mike's tip out to Coban would have been $17.60 again that's Mike Walton's tip out $17.60 to Coban

74
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,840
Cross and then Kevin Worley

75
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,800
his tip out should have been $31.20

76
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,640
um yeah so Kevin's final tips on this day would have just been $236.98

77
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:48,480
minus $31.20 and Mike Walton's tips would have been $87.44 minus $17.60 again no tip pool on that day

78
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,360
so I'm going to transcribe this and I'm excited

79
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:07,200
so this is Sunday night now October 19th 2025 um Coban was the expo and the Buster

80
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:24,160
um he should have made let's see so for this day Kevin gave me the total or excuse me so after

81
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,800
so after they add up all their tips before tip out so Kevin before tip out made $236.85

82
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:46,560
again that's $236.85 Mark made $313.70 before tip out so the total there is $550.55

83
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:57,520
cents that divided by two is $275.27 so we need to calculate each of their tips based on

84
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:08,400
the total tip out between the two of them to Coban Cross being $79.28 and that's the last one
