00:21.560 --> 00:33.320
October 13th through October 19th and that's a Monday through Sunday week

00:51.560 --> 01:20.760
okay and let's see

01:21.560 --> 01:36.160
on Wednesday October 15th Austin Kelly Mike Walton and Kevin Worley were the

01:36.160 --> 01:46.480
servers and each of them made $241.33 the Busser Slash Expo so he made 5% of

01:46.520 --> 01:54.920
food sales that day was Jamison and that tip-out was calculated as 60 bucks so

01:55.400 --> 02:23.440
so on Thursday August excuse me Thursday October 16th 2025 Austin Kelly and this

02:23.440 --> 02:35.160
is after tip-out for this day only Austin Kelly made $384 after tipping out

02:35.160 --> 02:41.040
Maddox Porter 60 bucks so exactly $60

04:06.160 --> 04:18.520
okay excuse me so now we're at so now we're at the Thursday p.m. shift and

04:18.520 --> 04:24.400
that's how all these are gonna be divided is between a.m. and p.m. shift so

04:24.400 --> 04:30.880
this is Thursday October 16th 2025 and again these are the final numbers so

04:30.880 --> 04:40.960
Austin Kelly Janelle Backey and Janelle Backey is spelled J-A-N-E-L B as in boy

04:40.960 --> 04:51.040
A-K-I and Heather Martin those were the three servers slash bartenders and each

04:51.040 --> 05:06.720
of them made $276.69 Coben and that's Coben cross and that's spelled C-O-B-E-N

05:06.720 --> 05:19.240
and then his last name is cross which is spelled C-R-O-S-S he made $123.54 and

05:19.360 --> 05:26.160
again that's after excuse me so those numbers I gave you for Austin Janelle

05:26.160 --> 05:30.080
and Heather those are all after tip-out

05:30.080 --> 05:49.200
okay and then for Friday October 17th we're tipping out Coben C as in Charlie

05:49.200 --> 05:57.880
O-B as in boy E-N Coben cross and it's a tip pool between Mike and Austin all

05:57.880 --> 06:02.080
these other days I've been tip pools too by the way so they tip pool you know

06:02.080 --> 06:10.760
I'd say 90% of the time and I want to start doing this for all of you know for

06:10.760 --> 06:18.120
a lot more things I want to use this as a way to just kind of like talk and you

06:18.120 --> 06:27.400
know see it reflected through productivity on AI would be sick okay so

06:27.600 --> 06:35.360
again Friday morning the a.m. shift on October 17th 2025 Mike Walton and Austin

06:35.360 --> 06:50.000
Kelly were tip pooling tipping out Coben excuse me Coben Mike had a hundred and

06:50.000 --> 06:55.880
twenty dollars and seven cents in fees or excuse me no he had a hundred and

06:55.880 --> 07:06.280
twenty dollars and seven cents in total tips the tip out to Coben would have

07:06.280 --> 07:18.200
been $22.30 and on this day he was making five percent because he was making five

07:18.200 --> 07:30.360
percent because he was expo and Buster also known as a utility guy so that was

07:30.360 --> 07:38.840
Mike's tips again Coben was getting tipped out but I just gave you Mike's

07:38.840 --> 07:49.520
report now we're moving on to Austin Kelly's report total tips were $95 total

07:49.520 --> 08:00.160
tip out was $19.69 and he and Mike are just going to be splitting that tip out

08:00.160 --> 08:21.920
Friday night the servers were Janelle Austin Kelly and it's Janelle back again

08:21.920 --> 08:51.200
and Mike Walton Janelle did $494.92 in tips her tip out would have been $64.25

08:51.200 --> 08:59.640
to the Buster which is four percent of food and $16.06 to the expo which is one

08:59.640 --> 09:06.400
percent of food for a total of $80.31 I'm not sure who the Buster was on Friday

09:06.400 --> 09:15.040
October 17th for the p.m. shift so I'm gonna have to figure that out but that's

09:15.360 --> 09:25.360
did in tips and what her tip out should have been Austin Kelly's tips $480.58 total excuse

09:25.360 --> 09:40.800
me so the Buster tip out was $35.69 expo was $8.92 for a total of $44.61 Mike Walton's

09:40.880 --> 09:52.880
total tips were $322.99 the tip out so again so these total tips that I'm saying for all these

09:52.880 --> 09:58.880
reports every single one I ever tell you when I'm like the total tips on their report those are all

09:58.880 --> 10:07.440
before tip out so so you know tip out needs to be subtracted from those numbers so you know in this

10:07.520 --> 10:19.680
case his total tips were $322.99 and then we have to you know we would have or we need to subtract

10:20.880 --> 10:27.120
or we need to pull their tip out but what the tip out would be for if they weren't pulling for Mike

10:27.840 --> 10:36.320
in this case to the Buster which is four percent of food would be $43.46 expo which is one percent

10:36.320 --> 10:44.160
of food would be $10.86 for a total of $54.32 for a tip out

11:06.320 --> 11:19.040
uh October 18th Saturday this is the AM shift

11:22.560 --> 11:31.680
uh Coban was the Buster and expo he um and then so look so these tips for the servers

11:32.320 --> 11:45.520
these are going to be after tip out so Janelle $299.98 Mark $299.98 so

11:45.520 --> 11:53.360
uh

11:57.680 --> 12:06.240
so yeah so earlier when I said something about that uh the tips on all the reports

12:06.240 --> 12:20.880
uh so when I read each individual server's tips and then I read their tip out that means that I'm

12:20.880 --> 12:29.760
reading it from their actual like toast report toast rpos and so that means that those need to

12:29.840 --> 12:38.160
be calculated like I need to figure out the the you know total tips after tip out and after pulling

12:38.960 --> 12:48.880
for those days but like for example for this one for October 18th which was Saturday morning

12:50.000 --> 12:51.120
yeah Saturday morning

12:54.240 --> 12:59.520
they wrote a little thing for me so they wrote a note for me and sometimes they'll do that

13:00.160 --> 13:05.680
and so this just is their final thing and I wish they would do this more often but

13:05.680 --> 13:17.280
so we have the final one today Janelle Bakke made $299.98 and Mark also made $299.98

13:18.000 --> 13:22.160
Coban was the Buster he made $111.45

13:22.240 --> 13:30.320
so that one is just on a silver platter um Saturday night

13:34.880 --> 13:42.000
Coban and Maddox um are going to split $131.11

13:42.000 --> 13:50.240
um and then so these again are after tip out

13:50.960 --> 13:58.400
it's Mark Buryanek and Buryanek is spelled B as in boy U-R-Y-A-N-E-K

14:00.320 --> 14:06.720
um Janelle Bakke again B as in boy A-K as in kangaroo I

14:07.520 --> 14:10.640
and Heather Martin

14:12.640 --> 14:19.680
so Mark so each one of those servers there's three of them again would have made $243.70

14:19.680 --> 14:34.240
so now on Sunday October 19th in the morning Kevin

14:37.840 --> 14:46.560
Worley and Mike Walton were the two servers they did not tip pool Coban was the expo slash Buster

14:49.680 --> 14:52.560
um

14:57.920 --> 15:08.880
and Mike's tip out to Coban would have been $17.60 again that's Mike Walton's tip out $17.60 to Coban

15:08.880 --> 15:15.840
Cross and then Kevin Worley

15:19.040 --> 15:22.800
his tip out should have been $31.20

15:26.800 --> 15:34.640
um yeah so Kevin's final tips on this day would have just been $236.98

15:35.280 --> 15:48.480
minus $31.20 and Mike Walton's tips would have been $87.44 minus $17.60 again no tip pool on that day

15:54.480 --> 15:57.360
so I'm going to transcribe this and I'm excited

15:58.160 --> 16:07.200
so this is Sunday night now October 19th 2025 um Coban was the expo and the Buster

16:13.360 --> 16:24.160
um he should have made let's see so for this day Kevin gave me the total or excuse me so after

16:24.880 --> 16:32.800
so after they add up all their tips before tip out so Kevin before tip out made $236.85

16:33.760 --> 16:46.560
again that's $236.85 Mark made $313.70 before tip out so the total there is $550.55

16:46.560 --> 16:57.520
cents that divided by two is $275.27 so we need to calculate each of their tips based on

16:58.160 --> 17:08.400
the total tip out between the two of them to Coban Cross being $79.28 and that's the last one
