00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
It was Brooke Neal solo.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Now on to Thursday, December 11th, 2025.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
This is the AM shift.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
It was Austin Kelly solo.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
So these are the final after tip out numbers.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
$140.02 after final numbers.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
On to Thursday, December 11th, 2025 PM shift.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
It was Austin Kelly.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
These are before tip out numbers because Ryan was the utility guy.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
So before tip out, Austin Kelly made $104.17.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $16.49.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
Now on to Friday, December 12th, 2025.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
Before tip out on Friday, December 12th, 2025 AM shift.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
Austin Kelly before tip out made $221.88.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $18.93.

04:08.000 --> 04:20.000
And for the PM shift, it was, let's see, so servers.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
And these are before tip out numbers.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
So we need to do the calculation like with the other before tip out ones.

04:28.000 --> 04:43.000
Austin Kelly before tip out $414.78 needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $49.34.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
Kevin Worley before tip out $156.84.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
And he needs to tip out $17.99.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
This was a tip pool, so Austin and Kevin need to make an equivalent number of tips after tip out.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
Now on to Saturday, December 13th, 2025.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
This is the AM shift.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
And Kevin and Austin were tip pooling.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
First I'll do Kevin. And again, so these are the before tip out numbers.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
So we need to do the calculation for that.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
And remember, again, Kevin and Austin are tip pooling here.

05:41.000 --> 05:53.000
Kevin Worley total tips and fees before tip out $151.80 needs to tip out Ryan $24.74.

05:53.000 --> 06:04.000
Austin Kelly $227.11 needs to tip out Ryan $40.55.

06:04.000 --> 06:12.000
Then Kevin also did a mid shift here.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And this is, there's no tip out here.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
So this is the final numbers.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
$122.72. And this was for Kevin's mid shift.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
So we can just add these numbers to the PM.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
But these numbers, that $122.72, again, that's a final number.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
And it's not tip pooling. Kevin is keeping all of that.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
Now on to Saturday, December 13th, 2025.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
This is the PM shift.

06:50.000 --> 07:00.000
Here are the final after tip out numbers.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Actually, wait, never mind. These are before tip out numbers.

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
So we need to do this calculation.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
But they were tip pooling. So it needs to be equal.

07:20.000 --> 07:29.000
And when I say they are tip pooling, I'm only referring to the front of house employees.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Mark's tips before tip out were $149.09.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
He needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $25.89.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
Kevin Worley before tip out made $125.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
But he needs to tip out Ryan Alexander $13.56.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Again, Mark and Kevin were tip pooling there.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
We need to keep that in mind when doing the calculation.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
Now on to Sunday, December 14th, 2025.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
These are the final numbers. Mark Baryanek $115.31.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
Mike Walton $115.31.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
Ryan Alexander $17.22.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Again, those were just the final numbers for that day.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Excuse me, for the AM shift, not for the day as a whole.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Just for the Sunday AM shift.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Now for the Sunday PM shift.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Here are the final numbers. Mark Baryanek $142.00.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
