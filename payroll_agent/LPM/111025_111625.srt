Okay, Monday PM shift.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Austin Kelly, and this is going to be before tip-out, so we need to subtract Coban's tip-out from this number.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Kelly did $164.82 in total tips and fees, and we need to subtract out $21.02 for Coban Cross, who was the utility guy.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Next is Tuesday November 11th, this is the AM shift.

Again, that's $164.14.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, so the utility guy was Coban Cross on this one, so we need to do that math.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, Austin Kelly before tip out made $164.14, and we need to subtract $23.85 as Coban's tip out.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He was the utility guy.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, on to Thursday November 13th 2025, this is the AM shift.

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It was Austin Kelly solo with no expo, bus or utility guy.

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000

Before tip out, Austin Kelly made $253.93.

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
