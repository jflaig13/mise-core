tip pool it was Heather, Kevin and Janelle. Heather had four and a half hours Kevin had four and a
half hours Janelle had two hours so we need to do the tip pool and use their hours to do the
calculation Heather Martin before tip-out $191.32 and she needs to tip out $35.40 total. Kevin Worley
before tip-out made $279.87 and he needs to tip out $39.35 looks like this came down to they figured
