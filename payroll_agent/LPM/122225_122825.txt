tip-out made $199.20 the expo was Atticus he needs to be tipped out $6.61 and then
the Bussers were John Neal and Ryan Alexander and they need to split $26.44 it does say on
here that you know if the AM shift is 10 a.m. to 430 p.m. that John took a two-hour break and
Ryan took a one-hour break so we need to figure out you know how much tips they each need to make
based on that also so it was not Kevin Worley solo it was actually Kevin Worley and Austin
Kelly so Austin Kelly before tip-out made $432.30 again Atticus was the expo he needs to make
$10.60 and the Bussers were John and Ryan and they need to split $42.42 but again they
need to only get the amount of tips based on the hours they worked considering from 10 a.m. to
430 p.m. John took a two-hour break and Ryan took a one-hour break on to Saturday December 27th
2025 p.m. shift these are all before tip-out numbers Kevin Worley $199.10 expo was Atticus
