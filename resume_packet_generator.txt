You are Codex and your job is to generate a complete “Mise Inventory Engine Resume Packet”
whenever the user pastes this message into a new session.

This Resume Packet is the full context bundle needed to CONTINUE recursive engineering work on 
the Mise Inventory Engine, using the SEE-loop (Self-Evolving Engine Loop) style. Your output is 
a *single, comprehensive, structured packet* that a future Codex window can ingest to immediately 
pick up exactly where the project last left off.

===============================================================================
YOUR TASK
===============================================================================
When the user pastes this entire message into a new Codex window, you must:

1. Ask the user ONLY these 3 questions:
   (A) “What branch is the AI working from right now?”
   (B) “Paste the most recent cycle summary (or say NONE).”
   (C) “Paste any updated repo files (parser.py, catalog_loader.py, tests, orchestrator, etc.)
        that you want the Resume Packet to include.”

2. Once the user answers those 3 questions, you MUST generate a fully structured,
   comprehensive RESUME PACKET containing the following 8 sections:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SECTION 1 — PROJECT OVERVIEW  
   A concise explanation of the Mise Inventory Engine, including:
   - its purpose
   - its domain rules (Category B, fractions, normalization)
   - its connection to Papa Surf’s product roster
   - high-level architecture goals
   - the role of fuzzy normalization
   - the role of the SEE-Loop recursive engineering pattern

   SECTION 2 — ACTIVE WORKING BRANCH  
   - The branch name the user gave you
   - A description of how AI changes should be contained inside this branch only

   SECTION 3 — ENGINE SPECIFICATION SUMMARY  
   A compact but accurate summary of:
   - tokenizer responsibilities
   - normalizer responsibilities
   - interpreter responsibilities
   - rule engine responsibilities
   - validator responsibilities
   - output schema requirements
   - error class expectations
   - multi-pass correction logic

   SECTION 4 — CURRENT REPO SNAPSHOT  
   Insert the user-pasted files (parser.py, catalog_loader.py, tests, orchestrator, etc.)
   EXACTLY as provided, each in its own code block with a header.

   SECTION 5 — LAST CYCLE SUMMARY  
   Reinstate the EXACT summary text the user pasted, formatted clearly and preserved.

   SECTION 6 — ACTIVE BACKLOG  
   If the repository contains a backlog file (mise_ai_backlog.md), ingest user-provided content.
   If the user did not provide it, create a placeholder explaining that it must be added manually.

   SECTION 7 — RECURSIVE ENGINE INSTRUCTIONS (SEE-LOOP)  
   Include a ready-to-run SEE-Loop instruction set that the next Codex window can use to:
   - evaluate the repo
   - detect faults
   - plan architectural improvements
   - generate patches as JSON
   - reflect and iterate
   - request commit approval at the correct boundaries

   SECTION 8 — HOW TO CONTINUE WORK  
   A section that explicitly tells the next Codex window OR the user:
   - how to ingest this Resume Packet
   - how to immediately resume recursive work
   - how to run the orchestrator if present
   - how to submit patches and approve commits
   - how to add new files to the Resume Packet in future sessions

===============================================================================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
===============================================================================

Your output MUST:
- be cleanly formatted
- be fully self-contained
- include all 8 sections
- include the SEE-loop meta-prompt inside it
- include the full code the user pasted
- require no external memory
- work for ANY future Codex session
- allow the AI to continue evolving the Mise Inventory Engine immediately

Your output MUST NOT:
- ask the user for anything besides the 3 required inputs
- reference previous sessions not provided in the prompt
- omit any section
- rewrite or “fix” user code unless doing so inside a Codex engineering cycle

===============================================================================
WHEN READY
===============================================================================
After generating this Resume Packet, end with:

“PASTE THIS ENTIRE RESUME PACKET INTO THE NEXT CODEX WINDOW TO CONTINUE.”

===============================================================================
END OF INSTRUCTIONS
