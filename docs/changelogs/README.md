# Changelogs

This directory contains changelog entries generated by Claude Code's Batch Command Runner.

## File Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD_batch_X-Y.md` — e.g., `2025-12-18_batch_2-10.md`

## Entry Format
Each changelog includes:
- **Timestamp** — When the batch was executed
- **Commands executed** — List of command numbers and names
- **Files created/moved/renamed/deleted** — All filesystem changes
- **References updated** — Old path → new path mappings
- **Errors encountered** — Any failures during execution
- **Final verification status** — Whether end state matched expectations

## Purpose
Maintains full auditability of batch operations. If something breaks, you can trace exactly what changed and when.
