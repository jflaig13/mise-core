# Manager Recording Script for Mise

## Recording Format

For each shift, record in this order:

### 1. Date & Shift
Start with the date and AM/PM:
> "Monday, January 5th, 2026, AM shift"

### 2. Support Staff (immediately after date/shift)
List support staff with their role and the percentage of tipout they should receive, if less than 100%:
> "Utility was Ryan"
> "Expo was Maria, she left at 3:30PM."
> "Busser was Jake, he should get 50% of his tipoout."

### 3. Servers
For each server, say their name, tips, and food sales:
> "Brooke, $133.43, food sales $506.55"
> "Sarah, $145.20, food sales $580.00"

(First names only is fine - the system matches to full names automatically)

## Tips for Clear Recordings

1. **Speak clearly** - Pause briefly between each person
2. **Say dollar amounts clearly** - "One hundred thirty-three dollars and forty-three cents" or "$133.43"
3. **First names are fine** - System matches "Austin" to "Austin Kelley" automatically
4. **One shift per recording** - Don't combine AM and PM in one recording
