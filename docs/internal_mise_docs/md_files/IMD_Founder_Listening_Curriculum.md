## Purpose

One canonical listening order, optimized for how your brain is actually building Mise right now — not for prestige, not for trivia, not for vibes.

This order follows an AGI-style curriculum:

1. First: How systems actually get built
2. Then: How intelligence gets productized
3. Then: How infrastructure scales
4. Then: How to understand your domain deeply
5. Finally: How durable companies survive

Each phase builds on the last. Skip nothing.

---

## Phase 1: Anthropic / Claude Founders (START HERE)

### Why First

This is the closest mental match to Mise:

- Guardrails over raw power
- Process over demos
- "Make the model productive" thinking
- Building tools for the model, not just users

You are already thinking like Anthropic. This sharpens that instinct.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 1 | **Tom Brown (Anthropic Co-founder)** — Claude Code / System Design | Foundational. How to design AI that does work. |
| 2 | **Dario Amodei** — Long Form Interview (AI safety + deployment) | How to build something powerful without losing control. Critical for payroll + ops + trust-heavy domains. |
| 3 | **Anthropic MCP / Tool Calling Discussions** | Directly maps to Mise's voice → action → verification pipeline. This is how you make AI actually do work. |

### Outcome

You internalize how to design AI systems that operate inside reality, not demos.

---

## Phase 2: OpenAI Leadership (AFTER YOU HAVE A FRAME)

### Why Second

OpenAI shows:

- What happens when things accidentally work
- How scale creates new problems
- Why distribution shocks matter

But if you start here, you'll copy the wrong lessons (hype over discipline).

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 4 | **Sam Altman** — Lex Fridman (longest one) | Big-picture intuition about timing, risk, inevitability. |
| 5 | **OpenAI ChatGPT Launch Retrospective** | Learn why even they didn't know it would work. Reinforces: you cannot predict, only iterate. |
| 6 | **Ilya Sutskever** — Scaling Laws / Emergence Talks | Teaches humility around intelligence. Reinforces why Mise must be process-driven, not model-driven. |

### Outcome

You stop over-forecasting and double down on learning loops.

---

## Phase 3: Jensen Huang / NVIDIA (INFRASTRUCTURE REALITY CHECK)

### Why Third

This reframes AI as:

- Physical
- Capital-intensive
- Bottlenecked by energy and compute

This protects you from building fantasies that don't survive the real world.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 7 | **Jensen Huang** — GTC Keynote (full) | Understand what actually limits AI. |
| 8 | **Jensen Huang** — Long Form Interview (AI agents, infrastructure) | Reinforces why applications > models for startups. |

### Outcome

You stop worrying about "labs killing you" and focus on owning workflows.

---

## Phase 4: Domain Mastery (HOSPITALITY)

### Why Fourth

You are building FOR restaurant operators. You must understand their world — not from a software lens, but from their lens. This is the difference between building a tool and building relief.

Mise's founder story is lived experience. This phase ensures you can speak to others who share it.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 9 | **Danny Meyer** — Setting the Table (audiobook or interviews) | The philosophy of hospitality: making people feel seen. Union Square Hospitality Group founder. Teaches the emotional core of what restaurants actually do. |
| 10 | **Will Guidara** — Unreasonable Hospitality (audiobook or podcast appearances) | Modern hospitality thinking: over-deliver on experience. Eleven Madison Park, world's best restaurant. Reinforces: Mise must feel like hospitality, not software. |
| 11 | **Restaurant operator podcasts / interviews** | Listen to how they describe their pain. Note the language they use (this becomes your copy). Suggested: "Restaurant Unstoppable," owner interviews on YouTube. |

### Outcome

You can speak to restaurant operators in their language, not yours.

---

## Phase 5: Voice AI & Conversational Systems

### Why Fifth

Voice is your differentiation. Text-first AI is crowded. Voice-first AI that actually works is rare. You need to understand why voice is different and what makes it hard.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 12 | **Scott Stephenson (Deepgram founder)** — Interviews | Speech recognition infrastructure. Why accuracy matters and where it breaks. |
| 13 | **Voice UX design talks / principles** | How voice interfaces differ from visual interfaces. Error handling, confirmation patterns, natural language. Suggested: Google's Conversation Design guidelines, Amazon Alexa design talks. |
| 14 | **Whisper / OpenAI speech recognition discussions** | Understand the tool you're using. Limitations, edge cases, multilingual challenges. |

### Outcome

You design for voice-first, not voice-as-afterthought.

---

## Phase 6: Palantir / Forward-Deployed Engineering

### Why Sixth

This is the playbook Mise will quietly follow:

- Embed
- Learn
- Encode
- Become irreplaceable

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 15 | **Alex Karp** — Long Form Palantir Interview | Moral seriousness + mission-driven software. |
| 16 | **Palantir Forward-Deployed Engineer Model** | This is exactly how Mise builds its moat in hospitality. |

### Outcome

You fully accept that "doing things that don't scale" is the scale strategy.

---

## Phase 7: Stripe & Direct Analogues (PROCESS POWER)

### Why Seventh

Stripe teaches:

- How to turn messy reality into clean primitives
- Why boring correctness wins decades later

Gusto teaches:

- How to build payroll for SMBs specifically
- The trust dynamics of handling people's money

Toast teaches:

- What the incumbent looks like
- Where they're strong, where they're weak

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 17 | **Patrick Collison** — Long Form Interview | Restraint, patience, and system design discipline. |
| 18 | **Stripe Early Days / Culture Talks** | Trust-first software. |
| 19 | **Josh Reeves (Gusto CEO)** — How I Built This / interviews | SMB payroll journey from zero. The trust required to handle people's money. How they built for small businesses, not enterprise. |
| 20 | **Toast founder interviews / S-1 analysis** | Understand the restaurant tech incumbent. Where they win: POS, hardware, distribution. Where they lose: support, complexity, voice. |

### Outcome

You stop chasing features and start designing foundations. You understand your direct analogues.

---

## Phase 8: Calm Company Philosophy

### Why Eighth

This phase reinforces VALUES_CORE. Mise refuses to operate in ways that degrade humanity. These thinkers built companies the same way.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 21 | **DHH / Jason Fried** — It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work (audiobook) | Calm company philosophy. Directly aligns with Mise's values: no dark patterns, no manufactured urgency. |
| 22 | **DHH interviews** — Building Basecamp / Hey | Profitability over growth-at-all-costs. User respect over engagement metrics. |
| 23 | **Sahil Lavingia** — The Minimalist Entrepreneur (audiobook) | Building sustainable, calm businesses. Relevant for single-founder or small team dynamics. |

### Outcome

You have philosophical grounding for why Mise's values are a moat, not a constraint.

---

## Phase 9: YC Tactical

### Why Ninth

If you're going through YC or applying, specific tactical preparation matters. These are not strategic — they're operational.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 24 | **Michael Seibel** — YC talks on early stage | How to talk about your startup. What YC actually looks for. |
| 25 | **Dalton Caldwell** — Finding product-market fit | Tactical advice on iteration. When to pivot, when to persist. |
| 26 | **How to Start a Startup** — YC lecture series (selected) | Suggested: Lecture 1 (Sam Altman), Lecture 3 (Paul Graham), Lecture 9 (Marc Andreessen). |

### Outcome

You're tactically prepared for YC, not just strategically.

---

## Phase 10: Meta-Thinkers (FINAL PASS)

### Why Last

These are interpretive lenses, not instructions.

### Listen in This Order

| # | Content | Key Lesson |
|---|---------|------------|
| 27 | **Ben Thompson** — AI Agents / Strategy Essays (Stratechery) | Helps you name what you already intuit. |
| 28 | **Paul Graham** — Essays (audio versions available) | "Do Things That Don't Scale," "Default Alive or Default Dead," "How to Get Startup Ideas." Emotional and psychological grounding. |

### Outcome

You develop calm, long-horizon conviction.

## Why This Matters for Mise

Each phase maps directly to a Mise design principle:

| Phase | Mise Application |
|-------|------------------|
| Anthropic | Brain architecture, workflow primacy, verification loops |
| OpenAI | Humility about what models can/can't do, iteration speed |
| NVIDIA | Focus on application layer, don't compete on compute |
| Hospitality | Speak their language, understand their pain, build relief |
| Voice AI | Differentiation through modality, not just features |
| Palantir | Forward-deployed model, embed with operators, encode domain knowledge |
| Stripe + Analogues | Trust primitives, boring correctness, learn from Gusto's journey |
| Calm Company | Values as moat, no dark patterns, long-term trust |
| YC Tactical | Operational readiness, not just strategic vision |
| Meta-thinkers | Strategic clarity, emotional resilience, long-horizon conviction |
