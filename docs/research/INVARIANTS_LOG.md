# Invariants Log

*A running record of durable principles discovered through research.*

## About This File

This file captures insights that appear to be structurally true — principles that hold across contexts, time periods, or scales. They are the kind of observations that, if correct, should influence how Mise thinks, builds, or operates over the long term.

**This file does not create law.** Entries here are hypotheses or durable insights, not binding rules. An invariant logged here has no authority over the codebase, product decisions, or company policy until a founder explicitly promotes it to canon through the appropriate channel.

Some entries may eventually be promoted to brain files (`docs/brain/`) or influence product architecture. Most will simply remain here as reference material — useful context for future decisions.

## Entry Format

Each invariant follows this structure:

```
### INV-[number]: [Short title]

**Statement:** [The invariant, stated as a clear, falsifiable claim]

**Source(s):** [Where this was discovered — research file, article, talk, observation]

**Confidence:** [Low / Medium / High]

**Applicability to Mise:** [How and where this applies to Mise's product, strategy, or operations]

**Canon candidate:** [Yes / No / Maybe — and brief rationale]

**Date logged:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
```
