## About This File

This is a simple tracking log. Every piece of media that enters the research pipeline gets an entry here before or during analysis.

**This log prevents redundant processing.** Before starting research on a new source, check this file. If it has already been processed, the detailed analysis is linked.

**This log provides provenance for insights.** When an invariant, recommendation, or open question references a source, this log is the canonical record of when and how that source was ingested.
