# Candidates for Canon

*A staging area for insights that may deserve promotion to institutional law.*

## About This File

This file holds research-derived insights that appear significant enough to potentially become part of Mise's canonical knowledge — brain files, workflow specs, governance documents, or architectural decisions.

**Nothing in this file is law.** An entry here is a recommendation, not an enactment. Every candidate requires explicit founder review before any canon or brain ingest occurs.

The barrier to entry here should be high. Not every interesting finding belongs in this file. Only insights that would materially change how Mise thinks, builds, or operates should be staged here.
