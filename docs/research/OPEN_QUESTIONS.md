## About This File

This file tracks questions that matter but do not yet have answers. Its purpose is intellectual honesty: to make visible the things we do not know, so that research can be directed toward the gaps that matter most.

This file is expected to grow and change. Questions will be added as research surfaces them. Some will be answered and marked resolved. Others may persist for months.

Not all questions need immediate answers. Some are worth holding open because the act of noticing the question is itself valuable — it prevents premature certainty.
