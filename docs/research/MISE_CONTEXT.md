# Mise Context Snapshot

## What Mise Is

Mise is a voice-first operational intelligence system for restaurants. It captures the operational data that restaurant managers already communicate verbally — shift payroll, inventory counts, daily notes — and converts it into structured, actionable records using AI transcription and domain-specific agents. The name comes from *mise en place*: everything in its place.

## Who It Is For

Independent restaurant operators and small multi-unit groups. The people who run the floor, close the books, and manage the staff — often the same person. Mise is built for the operator who currently tracks payroll in their head, counts inventory on a clipboard, and enters data into spreadsheets at the end of the week.

Primary domains today:
- **Payroll** — shift-level tip distribution, support staff tipouts, weekly totals, deliverable generation
- **Inventory** — voice-recorded shelf counts, AI-parsed product lists, period-based aggregation
- **Operations** — the connective tissue between these systems (scheduling, ordering, forecasting are on the roadmap)

## Core Differentiation

**Audio-first input.** Operators speak naturally while walking the floor or closing out a shift. Mise transcribes, parses, and structures the data. No forms, no typing, no switching between apps.

**AI-driven execution.** Domain-specific agents (payroll, inventory) understand restaurant context — shift codes, tip pool rules, product normalization, unit conversions. The AI does the clerical work. The operator reviews and approves.

**Operator empathy.** Mise is designed by people who have worked in restaurants. The product reflects how operators actually think and communicate, not how software engineers think operators should work. The interface is calm, direct, and fast.

## Current Phase

Mise is in early production with a single anchor client (Papa Surf Burger Bar, St. Petersburg, FL). The payroll system has run 20+ consecutive weeks of zero-error processing. The inventory system is in active use with voice recording and AI parsing deployed.

The company is a Delaware C-Corporation in the process of raising a $250K pre-seed round. The team is two co-founders (Jonathan Flaig, Austin Miett).

## Long-Term Ambition

Mise intends to become the default operational platform for independent restaurants — the system that handles payroll, inventory, ordering, scheduling, forecasting, and daily reporting through a single voice-first interface. The thesis is that restaurants generate enormous amounts of operational data through speech and routine, and that most of it is currently lost. Mise captures it.

The platform is designed to expand domain by domain, with each new agent building on the same audio-first input model and shared operational context. The competitive position strengthens with each domain added, because cross-domain intelligence (e.g., linking inventory depletion to sales forecasts) is only possible when one system holds all the data.
