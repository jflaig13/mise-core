# Ideas

Captured ideas, feature proposals, and speculative research. Created by the `/idea-capture` agent.

## File Naming

## Statuses

- **Draft** — Just captured, minimal research
- **Research** — Being actively researched
- **Validated** — Researched and approved
- **Parked** — Good idea, not now
- **Rejected** — Assessed and declined

## Priorities

- **P1** — Critical (blocking revenue/clients/fundraising)
- **P2** — High (important for next milestone)

## Escalation

When an idea becomes a permanent decision, it graduates to a brain file in `docs/brain/` via the brain ingest protocol.
