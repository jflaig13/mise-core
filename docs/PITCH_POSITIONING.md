## The 10-Second Pitch

> "I built Mise because I wanted my restaurant back."

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> "Last summer I was doing payroll, scheduling, inventory myself. I felt like I was never in my restaurant — just this constant loop of admin. I dreaded payroll night.
>
> That's when I realized: there are 500,000 single-location restaurants where the owner is doing exactly what I was doing.
>
> So I built the tool I needed. Now I talk through payroll on my drive home. It's done. I don't dread it anymore.
>
> That's Mise."

## The 2-Minute Pitch

> "I own Papa Surf, a restaurant in [location]. Last summer I didn't have an assistant manager. I was doing payroll, scheduling, and inventory all myself.
>
> I felt like I was never in my restaurant. Just this constant loop of never-ending admin. I'd do payroll at midnight after a 14-hour shift. Count inventory on my one day off. I was disconnected, frustrated, constantly chasing my tail.
>
> That's when I realized something: I'm not special. There are 500,000 single-location restaurants in America where the owner is doing exactly what I was doing. Working 70-hour weeks but feeling like they're never actually IN their restaurant.
>
> So I built Mise. Now I record payroll on my drive home — I just talk through the tips, the tipouts, who worked what shift. The system knows my rules, knows my employees, and produces the exact output I need for Toast. Done in minutes instead of hours.
>
> Same with inventory. I count while I walk around. Talk into my phone. It goes straight to MarginEdge.
>
> I got my restaurant back. I don't dread payroll anymore. The weight is lifted.
>
> That's what I'm selling — not software, not AI. Relief. For the 500,000 owners drowning in admin who just want to run their restaurant."

## Objection Handling

### "Who are your competitors?"

> "The voice AI market in restaurants is huge — $10 billion heading to $49 billion. But 100% of that investment is pointed at the customer: phone ordering, drive-thru, reservations.
>
> Meanwhile, the back office is still 1990s tech. Sit at a computer. Type into forms. Manual entry.
>
> We're not competing with voice AI companies — they don't do back office. We're not competing with back office software — they don't do voice. We're creating the category: voice-first operations for the person who runs the restaurant."

### "Why hasn't Toast done this?"

> "Toast makes money on payment processing and software subscriptions. They're optimized for breadth across 120,000 restaurants. They can't sit with one owner for months learning their specific tip pooling rules.
>
> Building Mise required deep domain encoding — my exact tip pool splits, my employee names and their variations, my DST-based shift schedules. Toast can't do this for 120,000 different rule sets.
>
> They'll eventually launch 'Toast Voice.' It'll be generic, checkbox features designed by committee. We'll have years of depth they can't match."

### "What's your moat?"

> "Three moats:
>
> First, workflow specs as code. Every restaurant has different rules. We've built a system where restaurant-specific logic lives in version-controlled files. Competitors rebuild from scratch.
>
> Second, the brain grows with usage. Every payroll I process teaches the system. Name normalization gets better. Edge cases get documented. After a year, the brain knows things no competitor can learn without that same year.
>
> Third, workflow lock-in. Once my entire operational rhythm flows through Mise, switching means re-learning everything. Not because I'm trapped — because the system has become MY system."

### "Why now?"

> "Three things converged:
>
> Whisper made voice transcription free and accurate. LLMs made parsing messy human speech possible. And the labor crisis peaked — owners can't afford back-office staff, so they're doing it themselves, drowning in admin.
>
> Five years ago, the tech wasn't ready. Five years from now, someone else would have done it. Right now is the window."

### "Why focus on small restaurants?"

> "There are 500,000 single-location owner-operators in America. They don't have IT departments. They can't afford back-office staff. They're doing payroll at midnight after 14-hour shifts. They're one bad month from closing.
>
> Big players ignore them because they're low-value customers. That's exactly why the opportunity exists.
>
> Amazon started with books — not because books were the biggest market, but because books were the best wedge. Single-location restaurants are our books."

### "Can't someone just copy this?"

> "They'd need to find a restaurant owner willing to work with them for months. Learn all the edge cases through production errors. Encode rules, build integrations, validate outputs. That's 12-18 months minimum.
>
> By then, we'd have 2+ years of edge case knowledge. A brain that's learned from hundreds of payroll runs. Trust with customers who've used it successfully.
>
> The switching cost isn't money. It's risk. Why switch to an unproven system when Mise has been right 100% of the time for 2 years?"

### "What about when OpenAI releases something similar?"

> "They will. And it'll be generic.
>
> OpenAI's business model is horizontal infrastructure. They won't build restaurant-specific tip pooling logic. That's not their game.
>
> Horizontal AI is a commodity. Vertical AI that encodes domain expertise is a product. Shopify didn't worry about Amazon launching a website builder. They built for their specific customer so deeply that Amazon couldn't compete."

## Competitive Landscape

### What Exists

| Category | Players | Gap |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Customer-facing voice AI | Loman, VoicePlug, Vox AI | Pointed at customers, not owners |
| Scheduling | 7shifts, HotSchedules | Requires manual input |
| Back office | Restaurant365, Crunchtime | Enterprise-focused, requires typing |
| Payroll | Toast Payroll, Gusto | Auto-syncs POS, but cash tips and complex pools still manual |

### Our Position

> "Toast automates what the POS captures. Mise captures what the owner knows."

---

## Support Positioning

**The commitment:** US-based, English-speaking support only. No exceptions.

**Why it matters:**
- Restaurant owners have been burned by systems that created more work
- They called support and got offshore scripts from people who've never worked a rush
- Toast has 2.5 stars on support reviews

**The standard:**
- Response in minutes, not hours
- Restaurant-experienced team
- Direct line to someone who can actually fix it

**The line:**
> "We answer when you call. We understand your business. We fix it now."
