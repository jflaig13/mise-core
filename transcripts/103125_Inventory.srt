And then we also have a 12 pack of Scarpetta bottles right next to it.

12
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,820
And on top of that we have a six pack of Squealing Pig Sauvignon Blanc.

13
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,580

Three bottles of Gearbox Pinot Noir.

23
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:59,820
Nine, excuse me, I was going to say 19 bottles, but scratch that, 11 more bottles of Charles

24
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:12,420
de Fer, plus the one other one we counted earlier.

30
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:53,300
the Charles de Fer, the Marque de Caceres, or whatever, is equal with the Charles de

31
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Fer.

32
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
It's just like our Mimosa Prosecco.

33
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:12,060
All right.

34
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:23,820

We have three cases of Watermelon.

41
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:38,780
