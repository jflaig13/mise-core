guy and again those were final numbers.
Okay now we're on to the Tuesday AM shift, John Neal was the bartender slash server

for John Neal, this is before tip out so we still need to do the calculation there.
So before tip out, John made $219.55 and then Cobin's tip out will be $38.06.
So again John before tip out was $219.55, Cobin's tip out needs to be $38.06.
Okay and then Wednesday night again that's November 5th, 2025.
The Wednesday PM shift, these are final numbers so exactly what I say needs to be reflected
on the payroll.
Mike Walton and Brooke Neal each made $91.85 so again each of them made $91.85 and those
are the final numbers after tipping out Cobin, $31.20.
Okay now moving on to November 6th, 2025.

So this is just going to be the before tip out numbers.
Before tip out Austin Kelly made $254.12 but then he needs to tip out Matt Exporter
$35.41 so we need to do that calculation.
I need you as the AI, you to do that calculation.
Okay now moving on to November 6th, 2025, PM shift and this was Thursday.
These are the final numbers.
Austin Kelly and Heather Martin each made $206.13, excuse me, excuse me not 13, that
should be $206.73 so 73 cents not 13 cents.

Exporter $61.06.
Okay now Friday, November 7th, 2025.
This is the AM shift.
Austin Kelly and this is before tip out would have made $224.50 then he needs to tip out
Matt Exporter $38.70.
Okay and now Friday, Friday, November 7th, 2025.

This is now the PM shift.
Okay so this is now the after tip out numbers.
It was Kevin Worley and Mark Burianek each of them need to make $319.28 so each of them
made that.
So it was a tip pool situation like a lot of the other ones.
Again that's kind of the default is the tip pool.
So each of them need to have made $319.28.
After tipping out Cobin Cross, the utility guy, $91.77.

It was Kevin Worley and Mike Walton.
They did not tip pool but here are the final numbers.
Kevin Worley after tipping out Cobin needs to get $264.91 after tipping out $34.95.
So that's Kevin's specific tip out.
Mike's final tip number after tipping out is $42.37.
Again after tipping out Cobin Cross, $13.40.
So Cobin's total tip out should be $48.35.
Okay now as we talked about, the next step would be to send me the detailed math of every
shift every day.
So I can approve it and then once I approve it, I need you to generate the PDF summary
as well as the Excel version of the summary, excuse me, not the summary, the tip report.
The tip report is what I need.
And the tip report again includes on the PDF version, the first page is the weekly summary,
so just the final tip numbers for every employee and then the second page shows each shift.
It's the table that shows each shift each day, how much each employee made and then
page three on is the detailed math.
Okay now I also need to give you the cook's tips.
Okay and here are the cook's tips.
Warren Lewis needs to make $13.57 and that's it.
Warren Lewis is the only cook with tips that week, so that's the whole thing.
That's the whole payroll recording.
