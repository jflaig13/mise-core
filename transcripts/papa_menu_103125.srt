1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Okay, I'm going to read you all of the ingredients of everything on our menu.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,200
The first thing is, well I'm going to read through the burgers first.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,840
The first is the Burnin' It Down.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:37,200
The price of the Burnin' It Down meal is $19, and it includes fries.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,840
Two fluid ounces of Chipotle citrus barbecue sauce, four ounces of yellow onions, one slice

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:59,880
of bacon, 0.75 ounces of pepper jack cheese, two ounces of jaman jalapeño peppers, which are a

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:08,960
product from JC's Gourmet. The jaman jalapeños as well as the poppin' pimento and the tomato jam.

8
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,080
But again, the poppin' pimento is not on the Burnin' It Down.

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:24,160
And the tomato jam is not either. So again, the Burnin' It Down is just the two ounces of

10
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,760
Chipotle citrus barbecue sauce, four ounces of yellow onions, one slice of bacon, 0.75 ounces of

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:43,160
pepper jack slice cheese, two ounces of jaman jalapeños, 4.5 ounces of ground beef, one

12
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,320
4-inch sandwich roll, and five ounces of waffle fries. So again, the only reason why I even

13
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:59,440
mentioned the poppin' pimento and the tomato jam earlier was because those are also JC's Gourmet.

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,560
But the pimento cheese or the tomato jam are not on the Burnin' It Down.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:17,880
Okay, so the next one is going to be the beach cowboy. The beach cowboy also has 4.5 ounces of

16
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:39,160
ground beef, it has one sandwich roll, it has one ounce of lettuce, it has one ounce of fresh

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:50,240
tomatoes, two tablespoons of dill pickles, 0.5 ounces of American cheese, two tablespoons of

18
00:02:50,240 --> 00:03:02,960
surf sauce, and five ounces of waffle fries. The next one is the change-up. This one is on Texas

19
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,680
Toast, and it's two slices of Texas Toast. The total cost for the Texas Toast is 48 cents. So I'm

20
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,840
gonna start giving you the total cost after each one. There is 1.5 ounces of Swiss cheese, which

21
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:27,160
costs 0.5 cents. Four ounces of yellow onions, which costs 16 cents. Four and a half ounces of

22
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:39,000
ground beef, which costs $1.67. Two tablespoons of Papa's sauce, which costs 11 cents. And five

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,160
ounces of waffle fries, which costs 58 cents. The price on that one is $18, and it says the plate

24
00:03:48,160 --> 00:04:03,480
cost is 19.4%. So the change-up is 18 bucks. The beach cowboy is also 18 bucks. Of all these burgers,

25
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,120
the burning it down is the only one, which is $19. The beach cowboy is 18, the change-up is 18,

26
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:21,760
and the next one I'm doing too, the southern burger, also costs 18 bucks. It has one sandwich

27
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:29,560
roll, which is 29 cents. One four-inch sandwich roll. It has three ounces of the poppin' pimento

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,800
cheese, which is $1.31. It has one ounce of the tomato jam, which is actually called misbehaved

29
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,840
maters, but it's just the tomato jam from JC's Gourmet. One ounce of that, which is 31 cents.

30
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,880
Two tablespoons of dill pickles, which is 8 cents. Four and a half ounces of ground beef,

31
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:06,160
which is $1.67. And five ounces of waffle fries, which is 58 cents. And again, that's the southern

32
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:23,760
burger, and that one costs 18 bucks. Okay, and then on to the steakhouse burger. That has one

33
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:31,120
four-inch sandwich roll, which is 29 cents. Two ounces of yellow onions, which is 8 cents. Two

34
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:41,640
ounces of mushrooms, which is 48 cents. 0.75 ounces of Swiss cheese, which is 25 cents. Four and a half

35
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:50,320
ounces of ground beef, which is $1.67. Five ounces of waffle fries, which is 58 cents. And then two

36
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,040
tablespoons of our Bernays aioli, which is 12 cents. The price on that one is $18.

37
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,440
And it says the plate cost there, the food cost, is 19.3 percent.

38
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,640
Okay, so that's the steakhouse. On to the jam sesh.

39
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,080
The jam sesh, formerly known as the holiday jam burger.

40
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:37,360
This one is also $18. Four and a half ounces of ground beef, one four-inch sandwich roll,

41
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,320
which is 29 cents. And then again, the four and a half ounces of beef that I mentioned as the first

42
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:50,080
line item, that's $1.67. And then the sandwich roll. And then two ounces of red onions, which

43
00:06:50,080 --> 00:07:01,280
is nine cents. Two ounces of goat cheese, which is a dollar and 45 cents. Two fluid ounces of cherry

44
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:12,160
jam, which is 76 cents. One slice of bacon, which is 46 cents. One ounce of baby arugula, which is

45
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,640
54 cents. And then five ounces of waffle fries, which are 58 cents. And the price on that one

46
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:33,120
is $18. Next, on to the black bean burger. So the black bean burger has...

47
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,600
So the black bean burger has one four-inch sandwich roll.

48
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,080
It has one ounce of lettuce, one ounce of fresh tomatoes, half ounce of yellow onions,

49
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,000
two tablespoons of dill pickles, five ounces of waffle fries,

50
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,160
and then... So each black bean patty is like its own prepped item. So we're using Marginal's

51
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:15,040
Edge here. So the price for each black bean patty is $2.80.

52
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,200
Each black bean patty is like its own prepped item. So we're using Marginal's Edge here. So

53
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:38,880
the price for each black bean patty is $2.23. So the total cost there is $3.49.

54
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,640
So the plate cost on the black bean burger is $20. Excuse me. The plate cost or a food cost

55
00:08:46,640 --> 00:09:02,720
would be 20.5 percent.

56
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
Pretty sure we serve six ounces of okra with each order.

57
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,920
And then so our wings that we get

58
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,360
are $5.66 a pound.

59
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,400
Our queso is $2.98 a pound.

60
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:11,360
Our tomato jam is $5 a pound.

61
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:32,000
The corn tortilla chips are $31.95 a case.

62
00:10:41,360 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay. And then I can just start it back up again and then start it back up again.
