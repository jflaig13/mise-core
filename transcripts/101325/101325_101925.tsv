106520	114920	food sales that day was Jamison and that tip-out was calculated as 60 bucks so
115400	143440	so on Thursday August excuse me Thursday October 16th 2025 Austin Kelly and this
143440	155160	is after tip-out for this day only Austin Kelly made $384 after tipping out
155160	161040	Maddox Porter 60 bucks so exactly $60
246160	258520	okay excuse me so now we're at so now we're at the Thursday p.m. shift and
258520	264400	that's how all these are gonna be divided is between a.m. and p.m. shift so
264400	270880	this is Thursday October 16th 2025 and again these are the final numbers so
270880	280960	Austin Kelly Janelle Backey and Janelle Backey is spelled J-A-N-E-L B as in boy
280960	291040	A-K-I and Heather Martin those were the three servers slash bartenders and each
291040	306720	of them made $276.69 Coben and that's Coben cross and that's spelled C-O-B-E-N
306720	319240	and then his last name is cross which is spelled C-R-O-S-S he made $123.54 and
319360	326160	again that's after excuse me so those numbers I gave you for Austin Janelle
326160	330080	and Heather those are all after tip-out
330080	349200	okay and then for Friday October 17th we're tipping out Coben C as in Charlie
349200	357880	O-B as in boy E-N Coben cross and it's a tip pool between Mike and Austin all
357880	362080	these other days I've been tip pools too by the way so they tip pool you know
362080	370760	I'd say 90% of the time and I want to start doing this for all of you know for
370760	378120	a lot more things I want to use this as a way to just kind of like talk and you
378120	387400	know see it reflected through productivity on AI would be sick okay so
387600	395360	again Friday morning the a.m. shift on October 17th 2025 Mike Walton and Austin
395360	410000	Kelly were tip pooling tipping out Coben excuse me Coben Mike had a hundred and
410000	415880	twenty dollars and seven cents in fees or excuse me no he had a hundred and
415880	426280	twenty dollars and seven cents in total tips the tip out to Coben would have
426280	438200	been $22.30 and on this day he was making five percent because he was making five
438200	450360	percent because he was expo and Buster also known as a utility guy so that was
450360	458840	Mike's tips again Coben was getting tipped out but I just gave you Mike's
458840	469520	report now we're moving on to Austin Kelly's report total tips were $95 total
469520	480160	tip out was $19.69 and he and Mike are just going to be splitting that tip out
480160	501920	Friday night the servers were Janelle Austin Kelly and it's Janelle back again
501920	531200	and Mike Walton Janelle did $494.92 in tips her tip out would have been $64.25
531200	539640	to the Buster which is four percent of food and $16.06 to the expo which is one
539640	546400	percent of food for a total of $80.31 I'm not sure who the Buster was on Friday
546400	555040	October 17th for the p.m. shift so I'm gonna have to figure that out but that's
555360	565360	did in tips and what her tip out should have been Austin Kelly's tips $480.58 total excuse
565360	580800	me so the Buster tip out was $35.69 expo was $8.92 for a total of $44.61 Mike Walton's
580880	592880	total tips were $322.99 the tip out so again so these total tips that I'm saying for all these
592880	598880	reports every single one I ever tell you when I'm like the total tips on their report those are all
598880	607440	before tip out so so you know tip out needs to be subtracted from those numbers so you know in this
607520	619680	case his total tips were $322.99 and then we have to you know we would have or we need to subtract
620880	627120	or we need to pull their tip out but what the tip out would be for if they weren't pulling for Mike
627840	636320	in this case to the Buster which is four percent of food would be $43.46 expo which is one percent
636320	644160	of food would be $10.86 for a total of $54.32 for a tip out
666320	679040	uh October 18th Saturday this is the AM shift
682560	691680	uh Coban was the Buster and expo he um and then so look so these tips for the servers
692320	705520	these are going to be after tip out so Janelle $299.98 Mark $299.98 so
705520	713360	uh
717680	726240	so yeah so earlier when I said something about that uh the tips on all the reports
726240	740880	uh so when I read each individual server's tips and then I read their tip out that means that I'm
740880	749760	reading it from their actual like toast report toast rpos and so that means that those need to
749840	758160	be calculated like I need to figure out the the you know total tips after tip out and after pulling
758960	768880	for those days but like for example for this one for October 18th which was Saturday morning
770000	771120	yeah Saturday morning
774240	779520	they wrote a little thing for me so they wrote a note for me and sometimes they'll do that
780160	785680	and so this just is their final thing and I wish they would do this more often but
785680	797280	so we have the final one today Janelle Bakke made $299.98 and Mark also made $299.98
798000	802160	Coban was the Buster he made $111.45
802240	810320	so that one is just on a silver platter um Saturday night
814880	822000	Coban and Maddox um are going to split $131.11
822000	830240	um and then so these again are after tip out
830960	838400	it's Mark Buryanek and Buryanek is spelled B as in boy U-R-Y-A-N-E-K
840320	846720	um Janelle Bakke again B as in boy A-K as in kangaroo I
847520	850640	and Heather Martin
852640	859680	so Mark so each one of those servers there's three of them again would have made $243.70
859680	874240	so now on Sunday October 19th in the morning Kevin
877840	886560	Worley and Mike Walton were the two servers they did not tip pool Coban was the expo slash Buster
889680	892560	um
897920	908880	and Mike's tip out to Coban would have been $17.60 again that's Mike Walton's tip out $17.60 to Coban
908880	915840	Cross and then Kevin Worley
919040	922800	his tip out should have been $31.20
926800	934640	um yeah so Kevin's final tips on this day would have just been $236.98
935280	948480	minus $31.20 and Mike Walton's tips would have been $87.44 minus $17.60 again no tip pool on that day
954480	957360	so I'm going to transcribe this and I'm excited
958160	967200	so this is Sunday night now October 19th 2025 um Coban was the expo and the Buster
973360	984160	um he should have made let's see so for this day Kevin gave me the total or excuse me so after
984880	992800	so after they add up all their tips before tip out so Kevin before tip out made $236.85
993760	1006560	again that's $236.85 Mark made $313.70 before tip out so the total there is $550.55
1006560	1017520	cents that divided by two is $275.27 so we need to calculate each of their tips based on
1018160	1028400	the total tip out between the two of them to Coban Cross being $79.28 and that's the last one
