0	12120	Okay, I'm going to read you all of the ingredients of everything on our menu.
12120	19200	The first thing is, well I'm going to read through the burgers first.
19200	22840	The first is the Burnin' It Down.
22840	37200	The price of the Burnin' It Down meal is $19, and it includes fries.
37200	47840	Two fluid ounces of Chipotle citrus barbecue sauce, four ounces of yellow onions, one slice
47840	59880	of bacon, 0.75 ounces of pepper jack cheese, two ounces of jaman jalapeño peppers, which are a
59880	68960	product from JC's Gourmet. The jaman jalapeños as well as the poppin' pimento and the tomato jam.
68960	75080	But again, the poppin' pimento is not on the Burnin' It Down.
75080	84160	And the tomato jam is not either. So again, the Burnin' It Down is just the two ounces of
84160	92760	Chipotle citrus barbecue sauce, four ounces of yellow onions, one slice of bacon, 0.75 ounces of
92760	103160	pepper jack slice cheese, two ounces of jaman jalapeños, 4.5 ounces of ground beef, one
103240	111320	4-inch sandwich roll, and five ounces of waffle fries. So again, the only reason why I even
111320	119440	mentioned the poppin' pimento and the tomato jam earlier was because those are also JC's Gourmet.
119440	126560	But the pimento cheese or the tomato jam are not on the Burnin' It Down.
126560	137880	Okay, so the next one is going to be the beach cowboy. The beach cowboy also has 4.5 ounces of
137880	159160	ground beef, it has one sandwich roll, it has one ounce of lettuce, it has one ounce of fresh
159160	170240	tomatoes, two tablespoons of dill pickles, 0.5 ounces of American cheese, two tablespoons of
170240	182960	surf sauce, and five ounces of waffle fries. The next one is the change-up. This one is on Texas
182960	189680	Toast, and it's two slices of Texas Toast. The total cost for the Texas Toast is 48 cents. So I'm
189680	196840	gonna start giving you the total cost after each one. There is 1.5 ounces of Swiss cheese, which
196840	207160	costs 0.5 cents. Four ounces of yellow onions, which costs 16 cents. Four and a half ounces of
207160	219000	ground beef, which costs $1.67. Two tablespoons of Papa's sauce, which costs 11 cents. And five
219000	228160	ounces of waffle fries, which costs 58 cents. The price on that one is $18, and it says the plate
228160	243480	cost is 19.4%. So the change-up is 18 bucks. The beach cowboy is also 18 bucks. Of all these burgers,
243480	250120	the burning it down is the only one, which is $19. The beach cowboy is 18, the change-up is 18,
250120	261760	and the next one I'm doing too, the southern burger, also costs 18 bucks. It has one sandwich
261760	269560	roll, which is 29 cents. One four-inch sandwich roll. It has three ounces of the poppin' pimento
269560	277800	cheese, which is $1.31. It has one ounce of the tomato jam, which is actually called misbehaved
277960	285840	maters, but it's just the tomato jam from JC's Gourmet. One ounce of that, which is 31 cents.
285840	292880	Two tablespoons of dill pickles, which is 8 cents. Four and a half ounces of ground beef,
292880	306160	which is $1.67. And five ounces of waffle fries, which is 58 cents. And again, that's the southern
306160	323760	burger, and that one costs 18 bucks. Okay, and then on to the steakhouse burger. That has one
323760	331120	four-inch sandwich roll, which is 29 cents. Two ounces of yellow onions, which is 8 cents. Two
331160	341640	ounces of mushrooms, which is 48 cents. 0.75 ounces of Swiss cheese, which is 25 cents. Four and a half
341640	350320	ounces of ground beef, which is $1.67. Five ounces of waffle fries, which is 58 cents. And then two
350320	357040	tablespoons of our Bernays aioli, which is 12 cents. The price on that one is $18.
362640	367440	And it says the plate cost there, the food cost, is 19.3 percent.
371680	376640	Okay, so that's the steakhouse. On to the jam sesh.
380400	384080	The jam sesh, formerly known as the holiday jam burger.
386560	397360	This one is also $18. Four and a half ounces of ground beef, one four-inch sandwich roll,
397360	402320	which is 29 cents. And then again, the four and a half ounces of beef that I mentioned as the first
402320	410080	line item, that's $1.67. And then the sandwich roll. And then two ounces of red onions, which
410080	421280	is nine cents. Two ounces of goat cheese, which is a dollar and 45 cents. Two fluid ounces of cherry
421280	432160	jam, which is 76 cents. One slice of bacon, which is 46 cents. One ounce of baby arugula, which is
432160	438640	54 cents. And then five ounces of waffle fries, which are 58 cents. And the price on that one
438640	453120	is $18. Next, on to the black bean burger. So the black bean burger has...
453120	455600	So the black bean burger has one four-inch sandwich roll.
458080	464080	It has one ounce of lettuce, one ounce of fresh tomatoes, half ounce of yellow onions,
464720	470000	two tablespoons of dill pickles, five ounces of waffle fries,
470800	476160	and then... So each black bean patty is like its own prepped item. So we're using Marginal's
476160	495040	Edge here. So the price for each black bean patty is $2.80.
495520	501200	Each black bean patty is like its own prepped item. So we're using Marginal's Edge here. So
501200	518880	the price for each black bean patty is $2.23. So the total cost there is $3.49.
518880	526640	So the plate cost on the black bean burger is $20. Excuse me. The plate cost or a food cost
526640	542720	would be 20.5 percent.
549360	552720	Pretty sure we serve six ounces of okra with each order.
567280	569920	And then so our wings that we get
569920	577360	are $5.66 a pound.
590080	594400	Our queso is $2.98 a pound.
600480	611360	Our tomato jam is $5 a pound.
611360	632000	The corn tortilla chips are $31.95 a case.
641360	666000	Okay. And then I can just start it back up again and then start it back up again.
