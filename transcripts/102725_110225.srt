5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:48,060
So those tips that I just gave you are the before tip out.

00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:56,860
So again, John was $72.32 and then need to tip out Cobin $10.

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,940

Okay and then what I'm about to give you is before tip out again.

15
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,320
So we need to calculate it.

16
00:02:46,320 --> 00:03:08,480
Austin and Kevin before tip out should have each made $192.45.

17
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:33,040
And then Maddox needs to be tipped out $38.03.

22
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:39,160

25
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:12,880

26
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:52,160
Okay, now for the Thursday morning shift.

27
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160

28
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,700
There was no tip out on this one.

29
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,440
So this tip number is the final amount $169.10.

30
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:13,280
Okay, and now let's do Thursday PM.

31

And before tip out, he made $321.82.

33
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,760
And he needed to tip out Maddox Porter $50.27.

34
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:36,200
So we'll need to subtract that from that $321.82 number to get the final tips.

35
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,920
Okay, so now Friday AM, it was just Austin Kelly solo.

00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,880
And there's no tip out.

37
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:47,120
