# Audit Inventory Path References
# This is an INSTRUCTION for Claude Code, not a shell script
#
# Claude: Search the entire mise-core repo for references to the OLD path:
#   - /mise-core/mise_inventory OR mise_inventory/
#
# For each reference found, report:
#   1. File path where reference exists
#   2. Line number
#   3. Current reference (old path)
#   4. Required new reference:
#      - mise_inventory/ → inventory_agent/
#
# Present ALL findings for user review before making any changes.
# Do NOT modify any files during this audit.

# Shell helper to find references (run this first):
echo "=== References to 'mise_inventory' ==="
