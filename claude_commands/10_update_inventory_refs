# Update Inventory Path References
# This is an INSTRUCTION for Claude Code, not a shell script
#
# Claude: Based on the audit from command #9, make the following replacements
# throughout mise-core. IMPORTANT: Present each change for approval BEFORE making it.
#
# Replacement map:
#   - "mise_inventory/" → "inventory_agent/"
#   - "/mise_inventory" → "/inventory_agent"
#   - "mise-core/mise_inventory" → "mise-core/inventory_agent"
#
# For EACH file that needs changes:
#   1. Show the file path
#   2. Show the specific lines being changed (before/after)
#   3. Ask: "Approve this change? (yes/no)"
#   4. Only proceed if user confirms
#
# Do NOT batch changes. One file at a time, one approval at a time.
