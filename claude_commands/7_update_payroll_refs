# Update Payroll Path References
# This is an INSTRUCTION for Claude Code, not a shell script
#
# Claude: Based on the audit from command #6, make the following replacements
# throughout mise-core. IMPORTANT: Present each change for approval BEFORE making it.
#
# Replacement map:
#   - "transcripts/" → "payroll_agent/lpm/"
#   - "/transcripts" → "/payroll_agent/lpm"
#   - "mise-core/transcripts" → "mise-core/payroll_agent/lpm"
#
#   - "engine/" → "payroll_agent/cpm/engine/"
#   - "/engine" → "/payroll_agent/cpm/engine"
#   - "mise-core/engine" → "mise-core/payroll_agent/cpm/engine"
#
#   - "transcribe/" → "payroll_agent/cpm/transcribe/"
#   - "/transcribe" → "/payroll_agent/cpm/transcribe"
#   - "mise-core/transcribe" → "mise-core/payroll_agent/cpm/transcribe"
#
# For EACH file that needs changes:
#   1. Show the file path
#   2. Show the specific lines being changed (before/after)
#   3. Ask: "Approve this change? (yes/no)"
#   4. Only proceed if user confirms
#
# Do NOT batch changes. One file at a time, one approval at a time.
