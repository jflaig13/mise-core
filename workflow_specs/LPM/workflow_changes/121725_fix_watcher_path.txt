CHANGE: Fixed watcher script DEFAULT_BASE path to use lowercase 'transcripts'
DATE: 2025-12-17
AUTHOR: Jon directive via Claude Code
FILES AFFECTED: transcripts/local_docs_watcher.sh

SUMMARY:
Changed DEFAULT_BASE in local_docs_watcher.sh from "$ROOT_DIR/Transcripts" (capital T)
to "$ROOT_DIR/transcripts" (lowercase t) to match the actual repo directory structure.

DETAILS:
Line 6 changed from:
  DEFAULT_BASE="$ROOT_DIR/Transcripts"
To:
  DEFAULT_BASE="$ROOT_DIR/transcripts"

RATIONALE:
The watcher was defaulting to the fallback location (/Users/jonathanflaig/Transcripts)
instead of the canonical repo location (mise-core/transcripts) because of the case
mismatch. This caused approval JSON files saved to mise-core/transcripts/approvals
to not be detected by the watcher.

With this fix, when the watcher is started from the repo, it will correctly monitor
mise-core/transcripts/approvals instead of falling back to ~/Transcripts.

ACTION REQUIRED:
User must restart the watcher for this change to take effect:
1. Stop current watcher process (kill PIDs 26584, 26586)
2. Start new watcher: cd ~/mise-core && ./transcripts/local_docs_watcher.sh
