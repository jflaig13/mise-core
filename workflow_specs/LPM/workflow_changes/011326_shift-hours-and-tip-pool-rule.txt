CHANGELOG: LPM Shift Hours and Tip Pool Default Rule
=====================================================

Date: 2025-01-13
Author: Jon (via Claude)

SUMMARY
-------
Added DST-based shift hours schedule and documented the cardinal tip pool default rule.

WHAT CHANGED
------------
1. Added Section 4.3: Shift Hours (DST-Based Schedule)
   - AM shift always 6.5 hours (10AM-4:30PM)
   - PM shift varies by day and DST status
   - Schedule changes on Monday after DST transitions

2. Added Section 4.4: Tip Pool Default Rule
   - If Jon doesn't mention how servers split tips, assume tip pool
   - Split evenly unless hours are stated
   - Only exception: explicit "NOT tip pooling" statement

FILES TOUCHED
-------------
- workflow_specs/LPM/LPM_Workflow_Master.txt
  - Added section 4.3: Shift Hours
  - Added section 4.4: Tip Pool Default Rule

- docs/brain/011326__lpm-shift-hours.md (NEW - created earlier)
  - Full DST schedule specification

WHY
---
1. Shift hours: Enables automatic calculation of PM shift durations without
   requiring explicit hours in every recording. Based on DST for simplicity
   (only 2 schedule changes per year).

2. Tip pool rule: Documents the cardinal rule that was previously implicit.
   Prevents errors where multi-server shifts are incorrectly processed as
   individual (non-pooled) shifts.

SHIFT HOURS SUMMARY
-------------------
AM: Always 6.5 hours (10AM-4:30PM)

DST (March-November):
- Sun-Thu: close 9PM (4.5 hr PM shift)
- Fri-Sat: close 10PM (5.5 hr PM shift)

Standard (November-March):
- Sun-Thu: close 8PM (3.5 hr PM shift)
- Fri-Sat: close 9PM (4.5 hr PM shift)

TIP POOL RULE
-------------
Multiple servers on a shift = tip pool (default)
Unless Jon explicitly states otherwise or provides individual final numbers.
