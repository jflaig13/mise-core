CHANGE: Added mandatory output format specification for Claude review step
DATE: 2025-12-17
AUTHOR: Jon directive via Claude Code
FILES AFFECTED: workflow_specs/LPM/LPM_Workflow_Master.txt

SUMMARY:
Added Section 5.1 "Required Output Format for Review (MANDATORY)" to LPM_Workflow_Master.txt.
This section specifies the exact format Claude must use when presenting payroll calculations
to Jon for review before generating the approval JSON.

DETAILS:
The new section mandates a 6-part output format:
1. Payroll Breakdown Section (shift-by-shift with calculations)
2. Per-Shift Totals Section (employee → shift amounts)
3. Weekly Totals Section (employee → weekly sum)
4. Detail Blocks Section (human-readable math)
5. Complete Payroll Summary Section (consolidated view with matrix)
6. Approval Prompt

This ensures consistent, reviewable output for all payroll runs.

RATIONALE:
Jon requested this format be permanently encoded into the workflow to ensure
the LPM always presents payroll data in a clear, verifiable format before
generating the approval JSON and triggering the automated runner.
