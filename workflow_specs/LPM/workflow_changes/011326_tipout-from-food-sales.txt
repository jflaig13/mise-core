CHANGELOG: LPM Tipout Calculation from Food Sales
==================================================

Date: 2025-01-13
Author: Jon (via Claude)

SUMMARY
-------
Changed tipout calculation method from explicitly stated amounts to percentage-based
calculation from food sales.

WHAT CHANGED
------------
1. Verbal input format now includes food sales per server
2. Tipouts calculated as percentages of total shift food sales:
   - Utility: 5%
   - Busser/Runner: 4%
   - Expo: 1%
3. Detail blocks now show food sales and tipout calculation formulas

FILES TOUCHED
-------------
- workflow_specs/LPM/LPM_Workflow_Master.txt
  - Added section 4.1: Verbal Input Format
  - Added section 4.2: Tipout Calculation Rules
  - Updated section 7.3.7: detail_blocks example and rules

- docs/brain/011326__lpm-tipout-from-food-sales.md (NEW)
  - Canonical brain doc for this rule

WHY
---
Jon requested this change to simplify the verbal recording process. Instead of
calculating and stating each tipout amount during recording, Jon now states only
the server's tips and food sales. The system calculates tipouts automatically
using fixed percentage rates.

NEW VERBAL FORMAT
-----------------
Old: "[Name] before tip-out made $[tips], needs to tip out busser $[amount], expo $[amount]"
New: "[Name], tips $[tips], food sales $[food sales]"

SUPPORT STAFF SPLIT RULES
-------------------------
- Multiple bussers: Split 4% evenly, or by hours if in tip pool
- Multiple expos: Split 1% evenly
- Multiple utility: Split 5% evenly, or by hours if in tip pool

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
----------------------
Old transcripts using explicit tipout amounts will need to be processed differently.
This change applies to all recordings made after 2025-01-13.
