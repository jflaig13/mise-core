Change: transcribe command works globally with absolute paths.
Files: ~/.mise_aliases, transcripts/LPM_workflow_120925.txt, transcripts/LPM_Workflow_Master.txt
Notes:
- transcribe is now a shell function using absolute paths; no need to cd into the repo.
- Workflow docs note that transcribe can run from any directory and still output to the repo transcripts folder (or LPM_TRANSCRIPTS_BASE override).
