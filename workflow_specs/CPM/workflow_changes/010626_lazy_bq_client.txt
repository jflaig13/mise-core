Change: Lazy-load BigQuery clients to prevent Cloud Run startup timeouts.
Files:
- payroll_agent/CPM/engine/payroll_engine.py
- payroll_agent/CPM/engine/commit_shift.py
Why:
- BigQuery auth was occurring at import time and could block uvicorn from binding to port 8080. Lazy init defers auth until first request.
Notes:
- No schema or workflow changes. Parsing and commit logic unchanged.
