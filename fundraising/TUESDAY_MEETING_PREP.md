# The Tuesday Meeting: What You Walk In Knowing

**Updated:** 2026-01-18
**Demo:** Tuesday, January 20th @ 1PM

---

You've spent six months building something real. Not a pitch deck with mockups. Not a "we're going to build" story. You've processed actual payroll — real money, real employees, real consequences — every single week since Q3 2025. That's 20+ weeks of production operation at Papa Surf while everyone else in restaurant tech is still drawing wireframes.

That's the foundation. Everything else builds from there.

## The Numbers You Say Without Thinking

When Boyd or Grady or whoever's in that room asks you a question, you don't fumble for numbers. You know them cold:

**The raise:** $250,000. Not $150K anymore. That old number is dead. You're raising $250K for 12 months of runway.

**The valuation:** You're targeting $3 million pre-money. That means investors get 7.7% for their $250K. If they push back and want $2.5 million, that's 10% — and that's Austin's ceiling. He agreed to give up a maximum of 10 points. You don't go below $2.5M pre.

**The cap table:** You own 60%. Austin owns 40%. After this round, you still own 60% — that's protected. Austin absorbs the dilution. At $3M, he goes to 32.3%. At $2.5M, he goes to 30%. This isn't negotiable. You're the operator. You built the product. You run the pilot. You're doing the investor meetings. Austin agreed to this structure.

**The allocation:** You're not waving your hands about how you'll spend the money. You've got it broken down: 48% to engineering ($120K for a lead engineer for 12 months), 16% to security and SOC 2 prep ($40K), 10% to infrastructure ($25K), 8% to QA ($20K), 6% to sales and onboarding ($15K), 4% to legal ($10K), and 8% contingency ($20K). That's a disciplined budget. That's not a founder who's going to burn cash on ping pong tables.

**The milestones:** By month 12, you're at 15-20 paying restaurants with $6-8K in monthly recurring revenue. Jon Flaig is full-time on Mise. SOC 2 Type 1 is complete. The inventory workflow is live. You're ready for Series A conversations.

**The pricing:** $149/month for Payroll, $249/month for Payroll + Inventory (full suite). Competitive, easy to say yes to. Most restaurants will start with payroll and upgrade when inventory launches.

**The unit economics:** CAC target is $500, LTV target is $3,600 at 24-month retention (at $149/month). LTV:CAC of ~7:1. Your gross margin is 90%+ because your only cost of goods is API calls — about $0.15 per shifty processed. At $149/month with ~60 shifties per restaurant, your cost is roughly $9/month per customer.

Say those numbers out loud a few times before Tuesday. They should feel like your own name.

## The Market Story

If they ask about market size, you don't panic. TAM is $7.2B — the US restaurant management software market. SAM is $800M — independent restaurants with 10-100 employees. SOM is $8M — restaurants in Texas using voice-first tools. You're starting hyperlocal and expanding.

But here's the number that actually matters: 500,000+ single-location owner-operators in the US. Seven in ten restaurants are single-unit operations. Nine in ten have fewer than 50 employees. These owners don't have IT departments. They can't afford back-office staff. They're doing payroll at midnight after 14-hour shifts. Big players ignore them because they're "low-value" customers.

That's exactly why the opportunity exists.

## The Story They Need to Hear

Investors hear pitches all day. Most of them blur together. Yours doesn't — but only if you tell it right.

You're not a tech bro who read an article about restaurants being inefficient. You've run Papa Surf. You've done payroll at midnight after 14-hour shifts. You've typed numbers into spreadsheets while your staff waited to know if they could pay rent. You built Mise because you wanted your restaurant back.

That's not a line. That's the truth. And it's the thing that separates you from every other founder who thinks they can "disrupt" hospitality with a mobile app.

You know things about restaurants that most tech people don't: that margins are 3-5%, that turnover is 70%+ annually, that managers are exhausted. They don't want software — they want their problem to go away. Mise succeeds by being invisible, not impressive. Restaurant managers don't have time for complex UIs or fancy dashboards. They need the pain to stop.

Here's what makes Mise different from everything else out there: the existing tools — Toast, 7shifts, MarketMan, all of them — they store data and display dashboards. None of them actually *do* the work. You still have to manually enter hours. You still have to manually approve shifts. You still have to manually count inventory and type it into a spreadsheet.

Mise executes. You speak, it acts. Voice to verified payroll in minutes. That's not a feature. That's a different category. And when the market figures out what to call this category, you'll already be operating inside it.

## The "Why Now" That Actually Matters

Three things changed: AI transcription hit 95%+ accuracy in 2024, labor costs are at historic highs forcing automation, and restaurant managers are finally smartphone-native. Five years ago, voice-to-payroll wasn't technically possible. Five years from now, someone else will have done it.

The voice AI market is going from $10B to $49B by 2029. You're riding that wave, not fighting it.

## The Questions They'll Ask (And What You Say)

**"$3 million seems high for pre-revenue."**

You're not pre-revenue in spirit. You're pre-revenue by choice. You've been running real payroll for 20+ weeks. You could flip a switch and start charging Papa Surf tomorrow. Down Island is ready to onboard as pilot #2. The product works. The only reason you don't have paying customers yet is because you've been focused on building, not billing. Revenue is a timing decision, not a capability question.

**"Why should we believe you can get to 10-20 restaurants?"**

Because you've already done the hardest part: making it work for one. And not a fake one — your own restaurant, with real stakes. Down Island is committed. You have relationships in the 30A restaurant community. The onboarding process is already defined. And frankly, restaurant owners talk to each other. When they see that Mise actually works — that it saves hours every week and eliminates the midnight spreadsheet sessions — word spreads.

**"What if a big player like Toast builds this?"**

Toast is a payments company that sells tablets. Their entire business model is transaction fees and hardware margins. They'll build horizontal tools, not vertical solutions. They won't build Texas-specific tip pooling rules. They won't know that a "utility" replaces expo+busser at 5%, that PM shifts have variable closing times, that managers say "COVID" when they mean "Coben." That's thousands of micro-decisions big tech won't make. Your moat is domain expertise encoded in the system, training data from every transcript you process, and switching costs once you're embedded in daily workflow. And if Toast does build something basic? It validates the market and you become an acquisition target.

**"What happens when the AI gets something wrong?"**

Every submission goes through an approval screen. The manager sees the parsed data, can edit any field, and confirms before it hits payroll. You're augmenting the manager, not replacing their judgment. Human-in-the-loop design isn't a limitation — it's a feature. It's why restaurants trust you with their payroll.

**"Why does Jon keep 60% while Austin dilutes?"**

Because you're the operator. You built the product. You run the pilot restaurant. You're doing the investor meetings. You'll be the one hiring the engineer and managing the roadmap. Austin contributed early and holds meaningful equity, but he agreed — before this fundraise — that this round's dilution comes from his stake. This was negotiated between co-founders. It's clean.

**"What's your unfair advantage?"**

Three things. First: you've actually run a restaurant. You know the pain viscerally, not from interviews. Second: you're already in production. This isn't a prototype — it's a working system that's processed tens of thousands of dollars in real payroll. Third: you built the entire product yourself, so your burn rate is near zero. You can iterate faster than any VC-backed competitor burning $200k/month on engineers.

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**

Sales. You're a builder by nature — you'd rather add features than cold-call restaurants. That's why this raise focuses on getting you into sales mode, and potentially hiring sales help. You know the gap and you're addressing it.

**"What keeps you up at night?"**

That a well-funded competitor shows up and outspends you before you establish the brand. You can't outspend anyone. You have to out-execute on product and customer love. That's the game you're playing.

## The Non-Negotiables

You need to be crystal clear on these before you walk in:

1. **You run the company.** Advisors advise. You decide.
2. **No board seats** for investors at this stage. Advisory only.
3. **No veto rights** on operations, hiring, product, or pricing.
4. **1x non-participating liquidation preference.** No double-dipping.
5. **No founder vesting** on your existing shares.
6. **Jon's 60% is protected.** Dilution comes from Austin's piece.

If they push on control: "I protect your investment by running the company well. I don't protect it by handing you the keys."

If they want more involvement than advisory: "I need advisors, not bosses. If that's a problem, this isn't the right investment for you."

## The Red Lines — Walk Away If...

- They demand board majority or veto power on operations
- "Participating preferred" (they get money back AND pro-rata share)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution (punishes you severely for down rounds)
- Requiring co-sign on bank accounts
- Founder vesting on YOUR existing shares
- Anything that makes them your boss, not your investor

You got burned once. You know what it feels like to lose control of something you cared about. That's not happening again.

## The Data Moat Nobody Else Has

Every transcript you process, every correction you make, every approval you log becomes training data. Over time you build the largest corpus of restaurant payroll voice data in existence. That's a moat no competitor can buy. AI wrappers aren't defensible. AI plus proprietary data plus domain logic can be. You have 50+ pages of business rules Claude uses to parse transcripts correctly. That knowledge compounds with every shifty.

## The Mindset You Walk In With

You're not asking for a favor. You're offering an opportunity.

These investors are looking for something that works, built by someone who won't quit, in a market that's big enough to matter. You check all three boxes.

You're not going to over-explain or over-apologize. You're not going to let them put you on your heels. If they want more control than you're offering, they're not the right partners. If they think $3 million is too high, you can have a conversation about $2.5 million — but you're not going below that, and you're not giving up more than 10%.

What would make you give up? Running out of money with no path to more. Or spending two years unable to get anyone to pay. But you're not close to either. This is year one — the time to push, not quit.

What will you do if this fails? Learn from it and try again. Probably something else in restaurant tech — you know the space. Failure isn't the end; quitting the game is.

But you're not planning to fail. You're planning to build something that gives restaurant owners their lives back.

Read this again Tuesday morning. Then walk in and tell them what Mise is.

*"I will protect your investment. I will not be controlled by it."*
