# Mise: Family Investment Proposal

**February 2026 | Confidential**

---

## The Ask

**$50,000 via a SAFE note** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity).

This is a standard early-stage investment instrument used by startups before a formal valuation has been set. Your $50K does not buy a fixed percentage of the company today. Instead, it converts to equity automatically when a professional investor leads a priced funding round — at a **20% discount** to whatever price that investor pays.

You are rewarded for going first.

## How the SAFE Works

### When a Seed Round Happens

| Scenario | Seed Valuation | Investor Price | Your Conversion Price (20% Discount) | Your Approximate Ownership |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Conservative | $3M | $3M | $2.4M | ~2.1% |
| Mid-range | $5M | $5M | $4M | ~1.25% |
| Strong | $7M | $7M | $5.6M | ~0.9% |

The lower the valuation at the time of the seed round, the larger your ownership stake. The higher the valuation, the smaller the percentage — but the company is worth more, so your stake is worth more in dollar terms.

### If No Round Happens

If Mise does not raise a priced equity round within 24 months, the $50,000 converts to a simple loan, repayable over 24 months. There is a defined outcome either way.

## Exactly What the Money Buys

One contract engineer for approximately six months. That is the entire use of funds.

| Item | Monthly Cost | 6-Month Total |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Contract engineer (25 hrs/week) | $6,500 | $39,000 |
| Software infrastructure (servers, AI tools) | $950 | $5,700 |
| Legal (SAFE paperwork, contractor agreement) | — | $500 |
| Reserve for unexpected costs | — | $4,800 |
| **Total** | | **$50,000** |

**What this is not funding:**

- Not my salary — I continue working full-time at Papa Surf
- Not office space, marketing, or overhead
- Not speculative R&D

Every dollar goes toward making the product secure, scalable, and ready to deploy at other restaurants.

## Why I Need an Engineer

Mise handles sensitive operational data — employee wages, hours worked, inventory counts, vendor orders, food costs. Before I deploy this at anyone else's restaurant, the software must be built to the standard that handling someone else's data demands.

That means:

- **Security hardening** — encryption, authentication, access controls
- **Data isolation** — Restaurant A never sees Restaurant B's data
- **Deployment infrastructure** — a clean, repeatable process for installing Mise at a new location
- **Testing** — automated checks so a payroll bug never reaches production

This is not work that can be done on nights and weekends between dinner services. It requires focused, professional engineering.

## The Plan: March – October 2026

### March – July (Peak Season)

I run Papa Surf. That is the priority and it does not change.

The engineer works independently — 25 hours per week — on security, architecture, and deployment infrastructure. I provide direction in the mornings before service and review their work after close. Five hours per week from me, twenty-five from them.

During this time, I also have conversations with two restaurants — **SoWal House** and **Down Island** — about piloting Mise in the fall.

### August – October (Post-Season)

The engineer has spent five months hardening the product. I now have more time. We deploy Mise at SoWal House and Down Island. By fall, three restaurants are running on the system with real usage data and real revenue.

### October Onward

Three live restaurants. Paying customers. Operational data proving the model works. From that position, I raise a proper seed round from professional investors — and the SAFE converts at your 20% discount.

## What Success Looks Like

| Metric | Today | After 6 Months |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Restaurants on Mise | 1 (Papa Surf) | 3 |
| Monthly revenue | $0 | $750 – $1,500 |
| Codebase status | Working prototype | Production-grade, secure, multi-tenant |
| Fundraising position | Pre-traction | 3 customers, real data, ready for seed round |

---

## The Risk

This is an early-stage investment. It carries real risk.

- The product might not work at restaurants beyond Papa Surf
- Other restaurants might not adopt it
- A larger competitor could ship similar features
- The seed round might take longer than expected

The SAFE's repayment clause provides downside protection, but this is not a guaranteed return. It is a bet on Mise and on me — with a defined fallback if things don't go as planned.

---

## The Bottom Line

Mise works. It runs Papa Surf's payroll today. The next step is making it ready for other people's restaurants — and that requires professional engineering I cannot do alone during peak season.

$50,000 buys six months of focused engineering, two new restaurant deployments, and a path to a real seed round where your investment converts to equity at a preferred price.
