## Negotiation Anchors

| If they say... | I say... |
|----------------|----------|
| "$3M is too high" | "What valuation works for you? I'm open to discussion." |
| "We want board seats" | "Happy to do advisory calls. Board stays founder-controlled." |
| "We want approval rights on X" | "On major liquidity events, yes. Not on day-to-day operations." |
| "We want more equity" | "10% is the ceiling. We could discuss vesting or milestones." |
| "We need more control" | "I protect your investment as CEO. But I won't be managed." |

---

## Red Flags - Walk Away If...

- They demand board majority or veto power on operations
- "Participating preferred" (they get money back AND pro-rata share)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution (punishes you severely for down rounds)
- Requiring co-sign on bank accounts
- Founder vesting on YOUR existing shares
- Anything that makes them your boss, not your investor

---

## What I Want Them to Understand

> "I will protect your investment. I will not be controlled by it."

> "You're betting on me. Let me run the company."

> "Advisory means I listen. It doesn't mean I obey."

## Grady's Concern (Valuation)

He said $3M seemed high. Options:

1. **Hold firm:** "Product is built, customer is live, I'm capital-efficient."
2. **Offer compromise:** "What about $2.5M? That's 12% for $150k."
3. **Structure differently:** "We could do a milestone-based valuation adjustment."

Pick based on how the conversation feels. Don't offer compromise first.

## Questions to Ask Them

1. "What's your typical investment timeline? Are you patient capital?"
2. "How hands-on do you like to be with your investments?"
3. "What does success look like to you in 3 years?"
4. "What concerns do you have that I haven't addressed?"
5. "Who else in your network might be interested if this goes well?"

## My Mantra

> "I got burned before. I won't let it happen again. I'm offering a fair deal — good returns for them, control for me. That's the deal. Take it or leave it."
