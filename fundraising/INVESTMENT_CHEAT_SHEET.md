## The Deal at a Glance

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Raising | **$250,000** |
| Target pre-money valuation | **$3,000,000** |
| Target equity | **7.7%** |
| Runway | 12 months |

---

## Two Scenarios (Be Ready for Both)

### Scenario A: $3M Pre-Money (Our Target)

| Stakeholder | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Jon | 60% | **60%** (protected) |
| Austin | 40% | **32.3%** |
| Investor | — | **7.7%** |

- Post-money: $3.25M
- Investor gets: $250K / $3.25M = 7.7%
- Austin gives up: 7.7%

### Scenario B: $2.5M Pre-Money (Investor Counter)

| Stakeholder | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Jon | 60% | **60%** (protected) |
| Austin | 40% | **30%** |
| Investor | — | **10%** |

- Post-money: $2.75M
- Investor gets: $250K / $2.75M = 9.1% (rounds to 10%)
- Austin gives up: 10%

**Austin's floor:** 10% dilution max (confirmed)

## My Non-Negotiables

1. **I run the company.** Advisors advise. I decide.
2. **No board seats** for investors. Advisory only.
3. **No veto rights** on operations, hiring, product, or pricing.
4. **1x non-participating** liquidation preference (no double-dipping).
5. **No founder vesting** on my existing shares.
6. **Jon's 60% is protected** — dilution comes from Austin's piece.

---

## What I'm Offering

- 7.7-10% equity for $250K (depending on valuation)
- Quarterly financial updates
- Pro-rata rights on future rounds
- Protective provisions on major events (sale, liquidation, down rounds)
- Direct access to me for advice and questions

## What They Bring

- Second pilot ready (Down Island)
- Full-time commitment post-funding

## Negotiation Anchors

| If they say... | I say... |
|----------------|----------|
| "$3M is too high" | "We have production traction — real payroll since Q3 2025. What valuation works for you?" |
| "We want 10% minimum" | "At $2.5M pre, that works. But $3M reflects the traction we have." |
| "We want board seats" | "Happy to do advisory calls. Board stays founder-controlled." |
| "We want approval rights on X" | "On major liquidity events, yes. Not on day-to-day operations." |
| "We want more equity" | "10% is Austin's ceiling. We could discuss milestones." |
| "We need more control" | "I protect your investment as CEO. But I won't be managed." |
| "Why does Jon stay at 60%?" | "I'm the operator. Austin agreed to take dilution for this round." |

---

## Defending $3M Valuation

1. **Production traction** — Real payroll running since Q3 2025, 20+ consecutive weeks
2. **Revenue-ready** — Down Island queued as paying pilot #2
3. **Technical moat** — Transrouter + domain agents already built, not vaporware
4. **Market timing** — Voice AI: $10B → $49B by 2029
5. **Founder-market fit** — I run the restaurant, I know the pain
6. **Capital efficient** — Built entire platform with minimal spend

---

## Red Flags - Walk Away If...

- They demand board majority or veto power on operations
- "Participating preferred" (they get money back AND pro-rata share)
- Full ratchet anti-dilution (punishes you severely for down rounds)
- Requiring co-sign on bank accounts
- Founder vesting on YOUR existing shares
- Anything that makes them your boss, not your investor

---

## What I Want Them to Understand

> "I will protect your investment. I will not be controlled by it."

> "You're betting on me. Let me run the company."

> "Advisory means I listen. It doesn't mean I obey."

---

## Questions to Ask Them

1. "What's your typical investment timeline? Are you patient capital?"
2. "How hands-on do you like to be with your investments?"
3. "What does success look like to you in 3 years?"
4. "What concerns do you have that I haven't addressed?"
5. "Who else in your network might be interested?"

---

## My Mantra

> "I got burned before. I won't let it happen again. I'm offering a fair deal — good returns for them, control for me. That's the deal. Take it or leave it."
