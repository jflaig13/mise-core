# The Human Fund — Idea Capture

**Status: Parked. Revisit when Mise hits $10K MRR.**

## The Idea

A Mise-affiliated non-profit that helps people who lost their jobs to AI find what's next — whether that's new work, new skills, or new purpose.

Instead of donating to an external charity, Mise "gives back" through its own Human Fund, so we know exactly where the money goes and how it's used.

## Three Lanes

1. **Want to work** — Help them find new employment. Job matching, resume help, interview prep, reskilling for roles AI hasn't replaced.
2. **Want to learn** — Teach them to use AI as a tool for the skill they want to develop. AI doesn't just take jobs — it gives superpowers to people willing to learn it.
3. **Want to live** — Help them find meaning outside of traditional employment. Surfing, creating, volunteering, whatever matters to them. Not everyone needs a job to have purpose.

## Core Belief

AI will displace people. The answer isn't to pretend it won't. The answer is to catch them when it does.

## Why Mise

- Mise is an AI company. We benefit from the same technology that displaces people. Owning that tension honestly — and doing something about it — is aligned with our values.
- The Primary Axiom: "Mise helps humanity by refusing to operate in ways that degrade it." A fund that directly supports displaced workers is the axiom in action.
- This is not PR. This is not a tax write-off strategy. This is what we believe.

## Trigger Condition

**Do not act on this until Mise reaches $10K MRR.**

When that happens, revisit this document and begin planning structure, funding model, and first initiatives.
