# Do Things That Don't Scale

### How Paul Graham's Most Important Essay Applies to Mise

## The Core Truth

The product will not spread because AI is hot, the parser is clever, or the architecture is elegant. Mise will spread because its founder personally installs it into real restaurants, fixes what breaks, and earns trust one owner at a time.

You are the crank. The engine does not self-start.

<div class="callout important" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">The Mise Advantage</div>

Most founders applying this advice are recruiting strangers to use something they built for a market they researched. Mise is different:

- **You ARE the user** (Papa Surf)
- **You built it for yourself first** — it works, you use it
- **Your peers are the market** — you speak their language
- **You understand their pain** because you live it daily

This is the strongest possible starting position.

## 1. The Flaig Installation

The Collison brothers at Stripe said *"Give me your laptop"* and set people up on the spot. They didn't send links. They didn't schedule demos.

**The Mise version:**

> "I can have you running payroll by voice tomorrow. What time does your lunch rush end? I'll come by at 3pm."

Drive there. Set them up. Record their first payroll with them. Watch them use it. Fix what breaks that night.

<div class="callout warning" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">The Trap to Avoid</div>

Sending links. Scheduling demos for "next week." Waiting for them to figure it out. Every day of delay is a day they forget, lose interest, or solve it another way.
</div>

---

## 2. The Right Growth Metric

Paul Graham talks about 10% weekly user growth. **That metric is wrong for Mise.**

<div class="stats-row">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">1</div>
<div class="label">Restaurant Using Daily = Massive</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">3</div>
<div class="label">Restaurants = Proof</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">5</div>
<div class="label">Restaurants = A Business</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">10</div>
<div class="label">Restaurants = Inevitability</div>
</div>
</div>

Mise's compounding metric is **operational replacement**, not user count. Measure **trust depth per location.**

A restaurant that runs every payroll through Mise is worth 100 signups who tried it once.

**The numbers that prove it:**

- "Payroll now takes 12 minutes instead of 90"
- "Inventory actually gets done"
- "I don't dread Monday anymore"

## 3. Fragility Is Sensitivity to Founder Effort

Airbnb was 30 days of in-person engagement away from death. They didn't know it at the time.

<div class="callout note" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">Mise Is Fragile Right Now (That's Normal)</div>

- Trust is not yet transferrable — it's tied to you personally
- Automation is not yet invisible — users see the seams
- You are still part of the loop — that's correct for now

**Fragility is not failure risk. Fragility is sensitivity to founder effort.** The next 90 days of in-person engagement could be the difference between Mise becoming real and Mise becoming a side project you used to work on.
</div>

## 4. Delight Means "This Thing Has My Back"

Wufoo sent hand-written thank-you notes to every new user. Mise's version of delight is different — and more powerful.

**Delight in Mise is NOT:**

- Swag or branded merch
- Polished onboarding emails
- UI animations

**Delight in Mise IS:**

- Fixing someone's payroll bug that night
- Calling after their first successful run: *"How did that feel?"*
- Explaining why the math works when they're nervous
- Generating the approval JSON cleanly — no surprises
- Texting when you ship a feature they asked for

<div class="pull-quote">
"This thing has my back."
<div class="attribution">— What every early user should feel</div>
</div>

Because you're small, you can deliver this in ways Toast never will. You can Slack them. You can FaceTime them. You can say "I fixed it" at 11pm.

**That is your unfair advantage.** Toast has 2.5 stars on support. You answer when they call.

## 5. Wizard of Oz Mode

Stripe delivered "instant" merchant accounts by manually signing people up behind the scenes. Users saw magic. The founders were the wizards.

    │                          │          │                          │

Every manual intervention teaches you:

- Where automation is dangerous
- What must never be ambiguous
- Where the product needs to harden

<div class="callout tip" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">The Reframe</div>

**Manual work that builds trust IS Mise.** Automation that breaks trust kills Mise. The human approval gate is not a compromise — it's the product.

## 6. Papa Surf Is Harvard

Facebook started Harvard-only. Not because they couldn't expand, but because **density creates heat.**

<div class="callout important" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">Mise's Contained Fire</div>

- **Geography:** 30A / Destin / PCB corridor
- **Type:** Full-service restaurants, tip-heavy
- **Size:** 8-25 employees
- **Owner:** Operators who do their own payroll

These are your peers. They trust you. They'll take your call. **This is your Harvard.**
</div>

**The rule:** Do not widen the market until:

1. The fire is hot — early users love it
2. The workflow is repeatable — you can onboard without heroics
3. The trust is transferrable — it's not just "Jon's thing"

If Mise dominates your exact archetype first, expansion is trivial later. If you try to expand before the fire is hot, you'll spread thin and freeze.

## 7. Ignore Big Launches Entirely

Paul Graham is explicit: big launches and partnerships almost never work for early-stage startups.

| Ignore | Pursue |
|--------|--------|
| Press coverage | "Wait, how did you close payroll already?" |
| Product Hunt launches | "You just talked and it worked?" |
| Partnership discussions with Toast/Square | "Can I try that?" |
| Viral marketing schemes | Word-of-mouth from delighted users |

If your early users aren't telling their friends, the product isn't good enough yet — and no launch will fix that.

---

## 8. The Mise Vector

Paul Graham's final insight: think of startups as vectors with two components.

| Component | Mise |
|-----------|------|
| **What you're building** | Voice-first operational intelligence for restaurants. Payroll + inventory as the wedge. |
| **The unscalable thing** | Founder-installed workflows. Manual approval. White-glove fixes. Deep trust building. Jon, personally, in restaurants. |

<div class="callout warning" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">Critical</div>

If either component disappears too early, Mise dies. The unscalable things are not a necessary evil — they are training data with muscle memory. They define the product. They become the culture.
</div>

## The Uncomfortable Truths

### Code Is Comfortable. Recruiting Is Not.

Paul Graham says it directly:

> "There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually. One is a combination of shyness and laziness."

Building features feels productive. Talking to strangers and getting rejected does not.

**But you're not talking to strangers.** You're talking to peers who share your pain. You have more credibility than any SaaS salesperson ever will.

### Claude Code Is Your Build Partner, Not Your Growth Partner

Claude can help you ship features fast. Claude cannot get you users.

| Claude's Job | Your Job |
|-------------|----------|
| Build what users ask for | Find users |
| Fix bugs fast | Install Mise in person |
| Ship features overnight | Earn trust |
| Automate what's proven | Learn what they need |

**If you're spending more time with Claude than with restaurant owners, the ratio is wrong.**

### Mise Is Not a Product Yet. It's a Relationship.

Right now, Mise is you + the software + the trust you've built. Without you in the loop, there is no Mise.

That's not a bug — it's the stage you're at. The goal is to transfer enough trust to the product that it can stand without you in every transaction. But you cannot skip the phase where you ARE the product.

---

## The Reframe That Matters Most

Paul Graham is writing for founders trying to escape work.

**You are doing the opposite.**

<div class="pull-quote">
"You are converting unavoidable work into permanent leverage."
<div class="attribution">— The Mise Superpower</div>
</div>

Every payroll run at Papa Surf is a test. Every edge case is a lesson. Every fix is product development. Every manual intervention is training data with muscle memory.

Most founders have to manufacture user feedback. **You live it.**

---

## The Concrete Plan

### Milestone #1

<div class="stats-row">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">3</div>
<div class="label">Real Restaurants by March 15</div>
</div>
</div>

**Not trials. Not demos.** Real payroll, real employees, real output.

**Definition of "real":**

- They've run at least 2 payrolls through Mise
- They're not going back to their old method
- They'd be upset if Mise disappeared

### The Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Monday** | Review: How many restaurants are using Mise? What broke last week? |
| **Tuesday** | Outreach: Contact 3 restaurant owners (call, not email) |
| **Wednesday** | Flaig Installation: Be physically present at a restaurant |
| **Thursday** | Build: Fix what broke, ship what was requested |
| **Friday** | Delight: Call every active user. "How was payroll this week?" |

### The 50/50 Rule

</div>

### Weekly Self-Check

1. How many restaurant owners did I talk to this week?
2. How many Flaig Installations did I do?
3. What broke? Did I fix it within 24 hours?
4. Are my active users happier than last week?
5. Can I name 3 restaurant owners I'll contact next week?

## The Final Test

If you do the unscalable things right:

- You won't need to raise — revenue will cover you
- You won't need hype — word of mouth will spread
- You won't need luck — you'll have earned inevitability

<div class="callout important" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">The Only Question That Matters</div>

The test is not "Is the product ready?"

The test is: **"How many restaurant owners will you talk to this week?"**
</div>

---

**Name 3 restaurant owners you can call today.**

**Schedule your first Flaig Installation for this week.**

**Everything else is commentary.**

*Mise: Everything in its place.*
