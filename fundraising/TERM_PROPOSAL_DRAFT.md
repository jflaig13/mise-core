## Protective Provisions (Requiring Investor Consent)

Investor consent required only for:

2. **Liquidation or dissolution** of the company
3. **Issuance of new equity** at a valuation lower than this round (down round)

## Founder Protections

### Anti-Dilution
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution (NOT full ratchet)
- Protects investors from severe dilution while being fair to founders

- In a sale, investors get their $250K back first, then all shareholders share remaining proceeds pro-rata
- NO participating preferred (no double-dipping)

### No Forced Founder Vesting
- Founder's existing shares are fully vested and not subject to any new vesting schedule
- This investment does not alter founder's equity position

### Drag-Along Threshold
- Drag-along rights only activate at 75%+ shareholder approval
- Prevents minority forcing a sale over founder objection

### Jon's Ownership Protection
- Jonathan Flaig's 60% ownership is protected and will not be diluted by this round
- All investor equity comes from Austin Miett's allocation per co-founder agreement

## Negotiation Notes

**On Valuation ($3M pre-money target):**
- Product is built and deployed (not just an idea)
- Live customer processing real payroll weekly since Q3 2025
- 20+ consecutive weeks of production operation
- Second pilot (Down Island) ready to onboard
- Solo founder = low burn rate, capital efficient
- Voice AI market: $10B → $49B by 2029
- *Open to $2.5M if valuation is the sticking point*

**On Control:**
- This is non-negotiable for the founder
- Burned in previous deal with passive role; won't repeat
- Will absolutely protect investor interests as fiduciary
- But final decisions must rest with CEO

**On Jon's Protected 60%:**
- Jon is the operator — building product, running pilot, doing investor relations
- Austin agreed to absorb dilution for this round
- This structure was negotiated between co-founders prior to fundraise

**On Structure:**
- Standard angel terms, nothing unusual
- Designed to be fair to both sides
- No tricky provisions that hurt either party
