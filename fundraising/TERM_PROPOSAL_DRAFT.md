  - Vendor/partner selection

### Advisory Role Only

---

## Protective Provisions (Requiring Investor Consent)

Investor consent required only for:

1. **Sale of the company** (merger, acquisition, or asset sale exceeding 50% of assets)
2. **Liquidation or dissolution** of the company
3. **Issuance of new equity** at a valuation lower than this round (down round)

## Founder Protections

### Anti-Dilution
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution (NOT full ratchet)
- Protects investors from severe dilution while being fair to founders

### Liquidation Preference

- In a sale, investors get their $150k back first, then all shareholders share remaining proceeds pro-rata
- NO participating preferred (no double-dipping)

### No Forced Founder Vesting
- Founder's existing shares are fully vested and not subject to any new vesting schedule
- This investment does not alter founder's equity position

### Drag-Along Threshold
- Drag-along rights only activate at 75%+ shareholder approval

2. **Information rights** with quarterly transparency
3. **Pro-rata rights** to maintain ownership in future rounds
4. **Protective provisions** on major liquidity/structure events
5. **Advisory relationship** with a founder who values their network and expertise

## What Investors Accept

1. **No board seats** or operational control

3. **Founder-friendly terms** (1x non-participating, weighted average anti-dilution)
4. **Trust in the founder** to run the company and protect their investment

---

## Negotiation Notes

**On Valuation ($3M pre-money):**
- Product is built and deployed (not just an idea)
- Live customer processing real payroll weekly
- Solo founder = low burn rate, capital efficient
- Comparable pre-seed restaurant tech raises: $2-4M range
- *Open to discussion if this is the sticking point*

**On Control:**
- This is non-negotiable for the founder
- Burned in previous deal with passive role; won't repeat
- Will absolutely protect investor interests as fiduciary
- But final decisions must rest with CEO

**On Structure:**
- Standard angel terms, nothing unusual
- Designed to be fair to both sides
- No tricky provisions that hurt either party
