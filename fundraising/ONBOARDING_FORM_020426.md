# New Restaurant Onboarding Form

### Everything Mise needs to get you running.

---

<div class="callout tip" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">This should take about 10 minutes.</div>

Fill out what you can. If you're unsure about anything, leave it blank and we'll figure it out together during setup. The fastest way to handle Section 2 is to pull your **Employee List export from Toast** and send it to us — we'll take care of the rest.

## Section 1: Your Restaurant

| Field | Your Answer |
|-------|-------------|
| **Restaurant Name** | |
| **Location (city, state)** | |
| **Days Open** *(e.g., Mon-Sun, Tue-Sat)* | |
| **Best Contact Name** | |

## Section 2: Your Team

Mise uses voice recordings to process payroll. We need to know your team so we can accurately recognize names from audio. **Include everyone who works tipped shifts.**

<div class="callout note" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">Easiest option</div>

Export your Employee List from Toast and email it to **jon@getmise.io**. That gives us names and IDs instantly. Then just add nicknames below.

## Section 4: Tip Rules

These are the rules Mise uses to calculate pay. **Getting this right is critical.** If you're unsure, just describe how you currently do it in the space at the bottom — we'll translate it into the right configuration.

### Tip Pooling

**When 2 or more servers work the same shift, what happens to their tips?**

&#9744; **Pool** — Tips are combined and split evenly between servers

&#9744; **Individual** — Each server keeps their own tips

&#9744; **Other** — Describe: _______________________________________________

### Tipout to Support Staff

**What percentage of food sales goes to each support role?**

| **Expo** | ______% | &#9744; Yes &#9744; No |
| **Other:** ____________ | ______% | &#9744; Yes &#9744; No |

### Anything Else About Tips?

*Describe any special rules, exceptions, or "the way we've always done it" here. Nothing is too small — if it affects how someone gets paid, we need to know.*

## What Happens Next

<div class="callout important" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">After you submit this form</div>

1. We configure Mise for your restaurant (takes us about 30 minutes)
2. We schedule your **setup session** — we come to you, in person
3. During setup, you'll record your first real payroll with us right there
4. We make sure everything is right before you go live
5. After that, you have a **direct line to support** — call or text anytime

You don't need to install anything. You don't need to learn software. You just talk.
