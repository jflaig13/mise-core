# Senior Software Engineer

**Mise — The Voice-First Operating System for Restaurants**

---

## About Mise

Mise is an AI-powered operations platform that turns spoken manager input into structured, verified business outputs. We're live in production — processing real payroll weekly at a real restaurant since Q3 2025. This isn't a prototype. It's a working system.

We're raising seed funding to scale from one restaurant to many. You'll be the first engineering hire.

---

## The Role

You'll inherit a working codebase built by the founder using Claude Code and extend it. The architecture is in place. The core workflows run. Your job is to make it faster, more reliable, and ready for scale.

**You will:**

- Own implementation from founder specs
- Extend the multi-agent system (Payroll, Inventory, Scheduling, Forecasting)
- Build integrations with POS systems, payroll providers, and inventory tools
- Write tests and improve coverage (currently ~40% → target 70%+)
- Handle infrastructure, CI/CD, and DevOps
- Ship features while the founder focuses on architecture and customers

**You won't:**

- Start from scratch — the system works
- Sit in meetings all day — we ship
- Need hand-holding — you're autonomous

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **AI/ML:** Claude API (Anthropic), Whisper (OpenAI)
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Run, BigQuery, Cloud Storage
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Tools:** GitHub, Linear, Claude Code / Cursor

---

## What We're Looking For

**Must-haves:**

- 5-8 years of software engineering experience
- Strong Python and FastAPI (or similar async frameworks)
- Experience inheriting and extending existing codebases
- Comfortable working autonomously from specs
- Already using AI-assisted development (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)

**Nice-to-haves:**

- Experience with multi-agent AI systems
- Background in restaurant tech, hospitality, or payroll
- Startup experience (you've seen messy and made it work)
- Remote work experience

---

## Why This Role

**You're not employee #47 at a Series C company.**

You're the first engineer at a company with:
- A working product in production
- Real traction (20+ weeks of live payroll)
- A founder who built the system himself and knows what good looks like
- A clear roadmap and funded runway

**You'll have impact.** Every line of code ships. Every feature matters. You'll see your work running in real restaurants within days, not quarters.

**You'll learn.** The founder built this with Claude Code. You'll work the same way — AI-native development at the frontier. This is how software gets built now.

## Compensation

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base Salary | $115,000/year |
| Health Insurance | Company contribution (~$400/month) |
| Equipment | MacBook Pro provided |
| Claude Max Subscription | Provided |
| Equity | Meaningful early-stage grant (details in offer) |

**Total comp: ~$130,000/year + equity**

---

## Location

**Remote-friendly** with preference for US-based candidates in similar time zones.

We're targeting candidates in mid-cost-of-living cities: Austin, Denver, Raleigh, Nashville, Tampa, Atlanta, or similar. SF/NYC comp expectations don't match our stage.

## How to Apply

**Send to:** jon@getmise.io

**Include:**

1. Your resume or LinkedIn
2. A brief note on why Mise interests you
3. **Required:** Show me something you built using Claude Code, Cursor, or similar AI tools. A GitHub link, a Loom video, a screenshot — whatever demonstrates you already work this way.

If AI-assisted development is already part of how you work, we should talk.

---

## Interview Process

1. **Intro call** (30 min) — We talk about the role, you ask questions
2. **Technical review** (60 min) — Walk me through code you've written, discuss the Mise architecture
3. **Paid trial project** (4-8 hours, compensated) — Small real task from our backlog
4. **Offer**

No leetcode. No whiteboard algorithms. We want to see how you actually work.

## About the Founder

**Jonathan Flaig** built Mise while running Papa Surf, a restaurant in Santa Rosa Beach, FL. He's done the 2am payroll runs. He knows the pain. He built the solution. This is founder-market fit in action.

**Timeline:** We're hiring immediately upon closing our seed round. If you're a fit, we move fast.

*Mise: Everything in its place.*
