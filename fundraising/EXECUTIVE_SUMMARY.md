# Mise — Executive Summary

**The Voice-First Virtual Executive Assistant for Restaurants**

---

## The Problem

500,000+ single-location restaurant owners in the US are drowning in back-office work.

- 7 in 10 restaurants are single-unit operations
- 9 in 10 have fewer than 50 employees
- Restaurant labor costs up 30% since 2019
- Owners are doing payroll at midnight after 14-hour shifts

They don't have IT departments. They can't afford back-office staff. They're typing numbers into spreadsheets while their families wait at home.

**The existing tools don't help.** Toast, 7shifts, MarketMan — they store data and display dashboards. None of them actually *do* the work.

---

## The Solution

**Mise executes.** You speak, it acts.

Mise is a voice-first virtual executive assistant that automates restaurant back-office operations. Instead of typing into spreadsheets, managers speak naturally and Mise handles the rest.

**How it works:**
1. Manager records a voice memo describing the shift ("Sarah worked 11 to 7, she's a bartender, pulled $400 in tips...")
2. Mise transcribes and interprets the audio using AI
3. Structured payroll data appears for approval
4. Manager reviews, approves, done

**Voice to verified payroll in minutes.** Not hours.
