- **Effective Date:** [DATE]

---

## 1. Advisory Role

### 1.1 Scope
Advisor agrees to provide advisory services to the Company, including but not limited to:
- Introductions to potential investors and funding sources
- Assistance with fundraising strategy and pitch refinement
- Introductions to potential engineering candidates
- General business guidance and mentorship

### 1.2 Time Commitment

### 1.3 Term
This Agreement shall remain in effect for four (4) years from the Vesting Start Date (defined below), unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 6.

---

## 2. Equity Compensation

### 2.1 Equity Grant
Subject to the milestone and vesting provisions below, Advisor shall be entitled to receive **[2.0]%** of the Company's fully-diluted common stock.

### 2.2 Form of Equity
Equity shall be granted as [common stock / stock options with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the Vesting Start Date], subject to the Company's standard equity agreements.

---

## 3. Milestone-Triggered Vesting

### 3.1 Vesting Start Date
**No equity shall vest until Milestone 1 is achieved.** The date Milestone 1 is achieved becomes the "Vesting Start Date."

### 3.2 Milestone Definitions

**Milestone 1 — Funding:**
The Company closes a qualified financing round of at least **$250,000** in aggregate proceeds, where Advisor made material contributions to the round through investor introductions, pitch assistance, or other direct involvement. "Material contribution" means Advisor introduced at least one investor who participated in the round, OR provided substantive assistance with pitch materials, investor meetings, or deal negotiation as acknowledged by the Company.

**Milestone 2 — Lead Engineer:**
The Company hires a lead software engineer who:
- Was introduced or sourced through Advisor's network or efforts, OR
- Advisor provided substantive assistance in recruiting, interviewing, or closing the candidate

AND that engineer remains employed by the Company for at least **90 consecutive days**.

### 3.3 Vesting Schedule

| Phase | Trigger | Vesting Rate |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Pre-Milestone 1** | Agreement signed | 0% — No vesting |
| **Phase 1** | Milestone 1 achieved | 50% rate — 1/96th of total grant vests monthly |
| **Phase 2** | Milestone 2 achieved | 100% rate — 1/48th of total grant vests monthly |

**How it works:**

1. **Before Milestone 1:** Clock hasn't started. No equity vests.

2. **After Milestone 1 (funding closed):** Vesting begins at 50% rate.
   - Advisor vests 1/96th of their total grant each month
   - At this rate, full vesting would take 8 years (but Milestone 2 accelerates this)

3. **After Milestone 2 (engineer hired + 90 days):** Vesting accelerates to 100% rate.
   - Advisor vests 1/48th of their total grant each month
   - All previously vested equity is retained
   - Remaining unvested equity vests at the accelerated rate
   - Full vesting occurs 4 years from the Vesting Start Date

**Example Timeline:**
- Jan 2026: Agreement signed
- June 2026: Milestone 1 achieved (funding closes) — Vesting Start Date
- June 2026 - Dec 2026: 7 months at 50% rate = 7/96 = 7.29% of grant vested
- Dec 2026: Milestone 2 achieved (engineer hired + 90 days) — Accelerates to 100%
- Dec 2026 - June 2030: Remaining 92.71% vests at 1/48th per month
- June 2030: Fully vested (4 years from Vesting Start Date)

### 3.4 Milestone Deadline
If Milestone 1 is not achieved within **eighteen (18) months** of the Effective Date, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and Advisor shall receive no equity.

### 3.5 Milestone 2 Deadline
If Milestone 2 is not achieved within **twelve (12) months** of Milestone 1, vesting shall continue at the 50% rate for the remainder of the vesting period. (Advisor still earns equity, just at the slower rate.)

---

## 4. Termination of Vesting

### 4.1 Voluntary Termination
If Advisor voluntarily terminates this Agreement, vesting shall immediately cease. Advisor retains all vested equity as of the termination date.

### 4.2 Termination for Cause
Company may terminate this Agreement for Cause, defined as:
- Material breach of this Agreement
- Breach of confidentiality obligations
- Conduct that brings the Company into disrepute
- Fraud, dishonesty, or gross negligence

Upon termination for Cause, vesting immediately ceases. Company may, at its discretion, repurchase unvested AND vested shares at the lower of fair market value or original exercise price.

### 4.3 Termination Without Cause
Company may terminate this Agreement without Cause upon 30 days written notice. If terminated without Cause after Milestone 1 is achieved:
- Advisor retains all vested equity
- An additional 6 months of vesting shall accelerate immediately (at the then-current vesting rate)

---

## 5. Confidentiality

### 5.1 Confidential Information
Advisor agrees to hold in confidence all non-public information regarding the Company, including but not limited to: business plans, financial information, customer data, technical information, and strategic plans.

### 5.2 Duration

### 6.2 No Authority to Bind
Advisor has no authority to enter into contracts or make commitments on behalf of the Company without express written authorization.

### 6.3 Intellectual Property
Any intellectual property created by Advisor specifically for the Company in the course of advisory services shall be assigned to the Company.
