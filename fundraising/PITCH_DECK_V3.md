# Mise Pitch Deck v3 — Slide Script

**General Purpose Deck | Build in Canva**

**Visual Direction:** Dark navy backgrounds with cream text for impact slides. White backgrounds with navy text for content slides. Food textures (wood grain, marble, linen) as subtle overlays. Mise red for accents and key numbers. Audiowave icon as recurring motif.

---

## Slide 1: Title

**Background:** Dark navy (#1B2A4E), full bleed

**Content:**

<div class="pull-quote">
Mise
</div>

The Voice-First Operating System for Restaurants

**Visual Direction:**
- Mise logo centered, large
- Audiowave icon subtly behind or below logo
- Tagline in cream below
- Clean, minimal — let the logo breathe
- Optional: faint food texture overlay (linen or dark wood)

**Speaker Notes:** "Mise — like mise en place, everything in its place. We're building the operating system for independent restaurants."

---

## Slide 2: The Story

**Background:** White, with a warm photo of a restaurant kitchen or bar (slightly dimmed)

**Content:**

<div class="pull-quote">
"I built Mise because I wanted my restaurant back."
<div class="attribution">— Jonathan Flaig, Founder & Owner, Papa Surf</div>
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Large pull quote, centered
- Photo of Papa Surf or a real restaurant environment behind text (50% opacity)
- Navy text, red attribution
- This is the emotional anchor — keep it simple

**Speaker Notes:** "Last summer I didn't have an assistant manager. I was doing payroll, scheduling, inventory — all myself. I literally felt like I was never in my restaurant. Just this constant loop of admin. I dreaded payroll night. That's when I realized: there are 500,000 other restaurant owners feeling exactly what I was feeling."

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### 500,000 restaurant owners are drowning in admin.

<div class="stats-row">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">7 in 10</div>
<div class="label">Restaurants are single-unit</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">9 in 10</div>
<div class="label">Have fewer than 50 employees</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">30%</div>
<div class="label">Labor cost increase since 2019</div>
</div>
</div>

They don't have IT departments. They can't afford back-office staff. They're doing payroll at midnight after 14-hour shifts.

<div class="callout important" markdown="1">
<div class="callout-title">The Gap</div>
The existing tools don't help. Toast, 7shifts, MarginEdge — they store data and display dashboards. None of them actually do the work.
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Three stat boxes in a row (use Mise red for the numbers)
- Bottom callout box with cream background
- Optional: dimmed stock photo of a tired restaurant owner working late at a laptop

**Speaker Notes:** "These owners are working 70-hour weeks. They're typing numbers into spreadsheets while their families wait at home. The tools that exist? They make you do more data entry, not less."

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

**Background:** Navy (#1B2A4E)

**Content:**

### Mise executes. You speak, it acts.

<div class="diagram">
  ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
  │  SPEAK   │ ───→ │TRANSCRIBE│ ───→ │ STRUCTURE│ ───→ │ APPROVE  │
  │          │      │          │      │          │      │          │
  │ Voice    │      │ AI Parse │      │ Verified │      │ One Tap  │
  │ Memo     │      │          │      │ Data     │      │ Done     │
  └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘
</div>

1. Manager records a voice memo describing the shift
2. Mise transcribes and interprets the audio using AI
3. Structured data appears for review
4. Manager approves. Done.

<div class="pull-quote">
Voice to verified payroll in minutes. Not hours.
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Cream text on navy background
- Four-step flow diagram with audiowave icons
- Pull quote at bottom in larger type
- Optional: phone mockup showing the voice recording interface

**Speaker Notes:** "Instead of typing into spreadsheets, you just talk. 'Sarah worked 11 to 7, she's a bartender, pulled $400 in tips.' The system knows your rules, knows your employees, produces exactly what you need."

---

## Slide 5: Traction

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### This isn't a prototype. It's production.

<div class="stats-row">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">20+</div>
<div class="label">Weeks of Live Payroll</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">0</div>
<div class="label">Payroll Errors</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">97%</div>
<div class="label">Time Saved</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="timeline">
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">Q3 2025</div>
<div class="event">Live at Papa Surf (Santa Rosa Beach, FL)</div>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">Q1 2026</div>
<div class="event">SoWal House onboarding</div>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">Q1-Q2 2026</div>
<div class="event">Down Island onboarding</div>
</div>
</div>

Real money. Real employees. Every week.

**Visual Direction:**
- Three large stat boxes across the top (red numbers, navy labels)
- Timeline below showing expansion
- Bold, confident layout — this is the credibility slide
- Optional: subtle screenshot of the Mise approval interface

**Speaker Notes:** "We've processed real payroll — real money, real employees — every week since Q3 2025 without a single error. What used to take 15 minutes now takes 30 seconds. Two more restaurants are in the pipeline."

## Slide 6: Market Opportunity

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### The Market

<div class="stats-row">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">$7.2B</div>
<div class="label">TAM — US Restaurant Management Software</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">$800M</div>
<div class="label">SAM — Independent, 10-100 Employees</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">$8M</div>
<div class="label">SOM — Initial Target</div>
</div>
</div>

**Tailwinds:**

- Voice AI market: $10B → $49B by 2029
- AI transcription hit 95%+ accuracy
- Labor costs forcing automation
- Restaurant managers are smartphone-native

**Visual Direction:**
- Three nested circles (concentric) showing TAM → SAM → SOM
- Or three stat boxes in descending size
- Tailwinds as icons with short labels below
- Clean, data-forward layout

**Speaker Notes:** "The total market for restaurant management software is $7.2 billion. We're targeting the 500,000 independent restaurants with 10-100 employees — the owners doing it themselves. That's an $800 million segment that the big players ignore because single-location restaurants are 'low-value customers.' That's exactly why the opportunity exists."

---

## Slide 7: Product Architecture

**Background:** Navy

**Content:**

### Multi-Agent Operating System

<div class="diagram">
                        ┌──────────────────────┐
                        │      TRANSROUTER      │
                        │   (Voice → Intent →   │
                        │      Agent Routing)   │
                        └──────────┬───────────┘
                                   │
              ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
              │                    │                    │
     ┌────────▼────────┐ ┌────────▼────────┐ ┌────────▼────────┐
     │    PAYROLL      │ │   INVENTORY     │ │  SCHEDULING     │
     │    AGENT        │ │    AGENT        │ │    AGENT        │
     │                 │ │                 │ │                 │
     │  ✓ Live         │ │  ✓ Live         │ │  Coming Soon    │
     └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
</div>

**Live Today:**
- Payroll Agent — voice-to-payroll, production since Q3 2025
- Inventory Agent — voice-to-inventory counts
- Transrouter — API gateway orchestrating all agents

**Built on:** Google Cloud Run (scales to zero), BigQuery, Claude API

**Visual Direction:**
- Architecture diagram with Transrouter at top, agents below
- Use audiowave icon in the Transrouter box
- Green checkmarks for live agents, gray for upcoming
- Navy background, cream text and boxes

**Speaker Notes:** "Mise isn't a chatbot. It's a multi-agent system. The Transrouter takes messy human speech, separates intents, and routes actions to specialized agents. One sentence might touch payroll and inventory — the system handles both. This is infrastructure, not prompting."

---

## Slide 8: Business Model

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### Simple, Scalable Pricing

| Tier | Price | What's Included |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Payroll | $149/month | Voice-to-payroll automation |
| Full Suite | $249/month | Payroll + Inventory + Scheduling |

**Unit Economics:**

<div class="stats-row">
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">90%+</div>
<div class="label">Gross Margin</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">7:1</div>
<div class="label">LTV:CAC</div>
</div>
<div class="stat-box">
<div class="number">$3,600</div>
<div class="label">LTV (24-mo)</div>
</div>
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Two-tier pricing table (clean, Mise branded)
- Stat boxes below for unit economics
- This slide should feel confident and simple
- No clutter — the economics speak for themselves

**Speaker Notes:** "$149 a month for payroll automation. $249 for the full suite. 90%+ gross margins. Software economics with a wedge into a market that's never been served this way."

---

## Slide 9: Competition

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### Everyone else is pointed the wrong way.

<table class="comparison">
<tr><th></th><th>Customer-Facing Voice AI</th><th>Back-Office Software</th><th>Mise</th></tr>
<tr><td>Who it serves</td><td>Customers (ordering, reservations)</td><td>Managers (dashboards, reports)</td><td class="yes">The Owner (operations)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Input method</td><td>Customer speaks</td><td class="no">Owner types</td><td class="yes">Owner speaks</td></tr>
<tr><td>What it does</td><td>Takes orders</td><td>Displays data</td><td class="yes">Executes work</td></tr>
<tr><td>Who benefits</td><td>The customer</td><td>Corporate/GMs</td><td class="yes">The owner-operator</td></tr>
</table>

<div class="pull-quote">
"Toast automates what the POS captures. Mise captures what the owner knows."
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Three-column comparison table
- Green checkmarks in Mise column, red X's for gaps in others
- Pull quote at bottom, large
- Clean white background, let the comparison do the work

**Speaker Notes:** "100% of voice AI investment in restaurants is pointed at the customer. 100% of back-office tools require you to sit at a computer and type. Nobody is building voice-first operations for the person who actually runs the restaurant. We're creating the category."

---

## Slide 10: Defensibility

**Background:** Navy

**Content:**

### The Moat Deepens Every Week

**1. Entropy Conversion**
Mise converts high-entropy human speech into zero-entropy, bank-safe execution. This is infrastructure, not a wrapper.

**2. The Brain Grows**
Every payroll processed teaches the system. Name normalization, edge cases, restaurant-specific rules — a year of depth no competitor can shortcut.

**3. Workflow Lock-In**
Once operations flow through Mise, switching means re-learning everything. Not because you're trapped — because the system has become YOUR system.

**4. Proprietary Data**
Pre-shift audio, manager intent, operational patterns — data that doesn't exist anywhere else.

**Visual Direction:**
- Iceberg visual: "What competitors see" above waterline (voice interface), "What they'd have to rebuild" below (workflow specs, domain encoding, edge case knowledge, integrations)
- Or four quadrant layout with icons for each moat
- Navy background, cream text

**Speaker Notes:** "If someone tries to copy Mise, they'd need to find a restaurant owner willing to work with them for 12-18 months, learn all the edge cases through production errors, encode restaurant-specific rules. By then, we'd have years of compounding depth they can't match."

---

## Slide 11: Team

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### Built by an Operator, Not a Consultant

**Jonathan Flaig — Founder & CEO**
- Restaurant operator (Papa Surf, Santa Rosa Beach, FL)
- Built entire Mise platform solo using AI-native development
- Technical + domain expertise in one person
- Founder-market fit: built the tool he needed, uses it every week

**Austin Miett — Co-Founder**
- Strategic partner, 40% equity

**Next Hire: Senior Engineer**
- AI-native developer (Claude Code fluent)
- Inherits and extends the working codebase
- Implementation focus while Jon handles architecture + customers

**Visual Direction:**
- Photo of Jon (real, at Papa Surf if possible)
- Clean layout, not corporate — authentic
- "Next Hire" section shows this is a team that's growing

**Speaker Notes:** "I'm not a consultant who studied restaurants. I own one. I've done the 2am payroll runs. I built the solution because I needed it. Now I'm hiring my first engineer to help me scale it."

---

## Slide 12: Roadmap

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### From 1 Restaurant to 20

<div class="timeline">
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">T1-T2</div>
<div class="event">Engineer onboarded, security hardening, SoWal House live</div>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">T3</div>
<div class="event">Down Island live (3 restaurants)</div>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">T4-T6</div>
<div class="event">5 paying restaurants, inventory workflow launch, ~$1.5K MRR</div>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">T7-T10</div>
<div class="event">10 restaurants, unit economics proven, SOC 2 prep</div>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<div class="date">T11-T12</div>
<div class="event">15-20 restaurants, $4K-8K MRR, Series A ready</div>
</div>
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Vertical timeline with Mise red dots at each milestone
- Navy accent line running down the left
- Keep it simple — 5 milestone blocks, not 12
- Optional: small stat callout showing MRR progression

**Speaker Notes:** "SoWal House and Down Island are in the pipeline now. The path from 1 to 3 is clear. From 3 to 20, we scale what works. By month 12, we're processing payroll at 15-20 restaurants with proven unit economics."

---

## Slide 13: The Ask (MODULAR — Swap Per Audience)

**Background:** Navy

### Version A: Seed Round ($250K)

**Content:**

### $250,000 to Scale from 1 to 20 Restaurants

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Senior Engineer | $130,000 (52%) |
| Security & SOC 2 | $35,000 (14%) |
| Infrastructure | $20,000 (8%) |
| QA & Testing | $15,000 (6%) |
| Sales & Onboarding | $12,000 (5%) |
| Legal & IP | $10,000 (4%) |
| Travel, Tools, Equipment | $18,000 (7%) |
| Contingency | $10,000 (4%) |

**Valuation:** $3M pre-money

---

### Version B: Friends & Family ($50K)

**Content:**

### $50,000 to Get to 3 Restaurants

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Engineering Contractor (5 months) | $40,000 |
| Claude Max Subscriptions (2 seats) | $1,000 |
| Infrastructure (GCP, APIs) | $4,000 |
| Buffer | $5,000 |

**Structure:** SAFE note — converts to equity at a discount when the seed round closes.

**What this buys:** A contractor to help Jon go from 1 restaurant to 3, proving multi-location works. Then raise the real seed from a position of strength.

---

**Visual Direction (both versions):**
- Clean allocation table
- One bold number at the top
- Pie chart or horizontal bar showing the breakdown
- Navy background, cream text
- Confident, specific — shows financial discipline

**Speaker Notes (Version A):** "We're raising $250,000 at a $3M pre-money valuation. 52% goes to our first engineer. The rest is security, infrastructure, and growth. By month 12: 15-20 restaurants, $4K-8K monthly recurring revenue, Series A ready."

**Speaker Notes (Version B):** "I need $50,000 to hire a contractor and get Mise running at three restaurants. That proves multi-location works. Then I raise a real seed round, and your investment converts to equity at a discount — rewarding you for betting early."

---

## Slide 14: Why Now

**Background:** White

**Content:**

### Three Things Converged

**1. The tech is ready.**
AI transcription hit 95%+ accuracy. LLMs can parse messy human speech into structured data. Five years ago, this was impossible.

**2. The pain is acute.**
Labor costs up 30%. Owners can't afford back-office staff. They're doing it themselves and drowning.

**3. Nobody else is doing this.**
All voice AI is pointed at customers. All back-office tools require typing. When voice-first operations gets a name, Mise will already be operating inside it.

**Visual Direction:**
- Three columns or three stacked blocks
- Icon for each (microphone, dollar sign, empty chair)
- Clean, white background
- This slide answers "why should I care right now"

**Speaker Notes:** "Five years ago, the tech wasn't ready. Five years from now, someone else will have done it. Right now is the window — and we're already in production."

---

## Slide 15: Close

**Background:** Navy, full bleed

**Content:**

<div class="pull-quote">
"I built Mise because I wanted my restaurant back."
</div>

500,000 other owners want theirs back too.

**jonathan@getmise.io | 770-845-3307**

<div class="pull-quote">
Mise: Everything in its place.
</div>

**Visual Direction:**
- Full navy background
- Quote large and centered
- Contact info below in cream
- Tagline at bottom
- Audiowave icon as a subtle watermark
- Mirror the simplicity of Slide 2 — bookend the deck

**Speaker Notes:** "I'm not pitching a product. I'm telling you I solved my own problem, and there are 500,000 other owners with the same problem. Let's talk."
