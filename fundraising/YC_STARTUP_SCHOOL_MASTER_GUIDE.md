# YC Startup School — Master Guide

**KPIs, Growth, and Prioritization (Early-Stage Founders)**

---

## Purpose of This Guide

This guide answers a single question:

**How should a founder decide what to work on each day in order to reach product-market fit as fast as possible?**

It synthesizes the final YC Startup School lesson on KPIs and prioritization into a practical operating manual. This is not motivational content. It is a decision-making framework meant to prevent wasted time, fake progress, and slow failure.

---

## The Core Idea

Startups do not fail because founders don't work hard. They fail because founders work hard on the wrong things.

KPIs define what matters. Prioritization defines what you do next. If either is wrong, effort is irrelevant.

---

## Why KPIs Matter

A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is not a vanity metric or a status update. It is a **truth constraint.**

A good primary KPI:

- Cannot be easily gamed
- Forces uncomfortable conversations
- Directly reflects whether users truly value the product

For the vast majority of startups post-launch, the correct primary KPI is:

**Growth — ideally revenue growth.**

Revenue bundles value, retention, urgency, and willingness to tolerate friction into a single signal.

---

## Primary vs Secondary KPIs

### Primary KPI

Your primary KPI answers one question:

**Is this business actually working?**

For most startups, that means revenue growth. There are limited exceptions (marketplaces, hardware, long-cycle enterprise), but even in those cases, the metric chosen must be a clear proxy for future revenue.

**You may only have one primary KPI.**

### Secondary KPIs

Secondary KPIs exist to:

- Explain why the primary KPI is or isn't moving
- Prevent cheating the primary KPI
- Provide early warning signals

Examples:

- Retention / churn
- Engagement or usage frequency
- Payback period (not full LTV)
- Conversion rates at key funnel steps

**Limit secondary KPIs to 3-5 maximum.**

---

## Vanity Metrics (What Not to Optimize)

Vanity metrics are dangerous because they feel good while telling you nothing.

Common examples:

- Free signups
- Raw DAUs without revenue
- Press mentions
- Conference buzz
- Feature count

**If a metric does not directly ladder into revenue growth, treat it with skepticism.**

---

## Growth Targets: How Much Is Enough?

Paul Graham's benchmark for YC companies:

- **5-7% week-over-week growth** = good
- **10%+ week-over-week growth** = exceptional

The exact percentage matters less than the trajectory. Small differences early compound dramatically.

Early growth is more valuable than late growth because:

- Feedback loops are tighter
- Learning compounds
- Momentum builds psychologically and operationally

---

## Retention vs Acquisition

This is not an either/or decision.

Rules of thumb:

- First, ensure churn is not killing you
- Do not pour new users into a broken experience
- Once retention is acceptable, push acquisition aggressively

Both retention and acquisition ultimately feed revenue growth.

---

## Tracking Real Behavior, Not Interest

The best KPIs track habits, not curiosity.

Example: SuperDaily stopped tracking signups. They tracked customers who placed 5+ orders. That behavior predicted long-term revenue.

**Track the action that proves the product is becoming part of someone's routine.**

---

## Setting Targets: Two Complementary Approaches

### Top-Down Target Setting

- Define a meaningful future milestone (e.g., $5k MRR)
- Work backwards to required weekly growth
- Obsess over the number

This prevents small thinking.

### Bottom-Up Target Setting

- Ask what is realistically achievable next week
- Project forward
- Remove imaginary constraints (e.g., funding) as a thought experiment

This prevents fantasy planning.

**Use both approaches regularly.**

---

## Why Slow Growth Is Dangerous

Slow growth is not fatal because it is low. It is fatal because it:

- Stretches feedback loops
- Obscures bottlenecks
- Encourages indecision
- Enables self-deception
- Allows entropy to outpace learning

**Fast growth compresses reality into weeks instead of months.**

---

## Prioritization: What Should Be on Your Task List

### High-Leverage Tasks (90% of your time)

- Talking to users
- Onboarding and support
- Iterating directly from user feedback
- Removing blockers to revenue growth

These have a direct path to learning and money.

### Fake Progress (Avoid)

- Passive fundraising conversations
- Conferences
- Arbitrary technical milestones
- Platform expansions not demanded by users
- Legal or structural micro-optimizations
- Hard problems nobody asked you to solve

These tasks feel productive but delay truth.

---

## Mental Traps Founders Fall Into

1. **Low-leverage comfort work** — easy wins that avoid rejection
2. **Mistaking slow growth for PMF** — gradual progress that never accelerates
3. **Perfectionism and indecision** — delaying action to avoid being wrong
4. **Downside protection over upside creation** — fixing small issues instead of changing behavior
5. **Avoiding the existential problem** — polishing features while growth is stalled

These traps are psychological, not intellectual.

---

## The Bottleneck Rule

Every week, there is exactly one biggest reason your primary KPI is not growing faster.

Your job:

1. Identify it honestly
2. Attack only that
3. Ignore everything else

**Fix the leak closest to revenue first.**

---

## The Weekly Operating Loop

1. Set your primary KPI
2. Define a weekly growth goal
3. Identify the single biggest bottleneck
4. Choose 1-2 initiatives to attack it
5. Execute fast
6. Review honestly
7. Adjust next week

Repeat.

---

## The Governing Rule

**If a task does not plausibly move your primary KPI this week, it is not a priority.**

Discipline here is what separates momentum from stagnation.

---

## Final Takeaway

This lesson is not about metrics.

It is about forcing reality to talk back to you early and often.

Growth is not the goal. Growth is the signal. If you listen to it, prioritize accordingly, and move fast, product-market fit becomes inevitable rather than mysterious.

## Applied to Mise — Right Now (February 2026)

Everything above is general wisdom. Here's what it actually means for Mise today.

### Mise's Current Reality

- 1 restaurant in production (Papa Surf — founder-owned)
- 0 paying customers
- 20+ consecutive weeks of real payroll processing, zero errors
- Inventory module functional, being refined
- $50K family investment secured
- Contractor about to be hired for security/architecture
- Down Island ready to onboard as pilot #2

### Mise's Primary KPI

Mise has $0 MRR. You can't grow revenue from zero. So the pre-revenue primary KPI is:

**Number of restaurants actively using Mise for real operations weekly.**

Right now: 1. The goal is to get to 3-5 as fast as possible while maintaining the zero-error standard. The moment any of those restaurants are paying, the primary KPI flips to **MRR growth.**

### Mise's Secondary KPIs

1. **Weekly usage rate** — Are onboarded restaurants actually recording every week, or did they stop? This is Mise's retention signal.
2. **Time from recording to approved payroll** — Measures product quality. If this is going up, something is broken. If it's going down, the product is getting better.
3. **Conversion: pilot to paying** — Once you have 3-5 active restaurants, how many agree to pay? This tells you whether the product is "nice to have" or "need to have."

### What Counts as Fake Progress for Mise

Be honest about this list:

- **Building features nobody asked for** — scheduling, ordering, and forecasting are planned, but no external user has demanded them yet. Don't build them until someone does.
- **Perfecting the codebase before deploying to a second restaurant** — the contractor is for security and architecture, not for making the code pretty. Ship to Down Island first. Fix what breaks.
- **Fundraising conversations that aren't the seed round** — you have $50K. Use it. Don't spend weeks talking to investors until you have 5+ restaurants and revenue.
- **Brand and marketing polish** — LinkedIn page, taglines, and pitch decks matter when you're raising. Right now, the only marketing that matters is getting the next restaurant live.
- **Internal documentation beyond what's needed** — docs serve onboarding (Austin) and development (contractor). If a doc doesn't serve one of those two purposes right now, it can wait.

### What High-Leverage Tasks Look Like for Mise

- **Get Down Island live.** This is the single most important thing. A second restaurant using Mise weekly proves this isn't a personal tool — it's a product.
- **Talk to 5-10 independent restaurant owners.** Not to sell. To understand their pain. Ask: "How do you do payroll right now? How long does it take? What do you hate about it?" Validate that the Papa Surf pain is universal.
- **Onboard Austin effectively.** He's your co-founder. Every hour invested in his ramp-up multiplies your capacity. This is leverage, not overhead.
- **Hire and direct the contractor.** Security hardening and multi-tenant architecture are the blockers to deploying at any restaurant besides Papa Surf.
- **Record every onboarding friction point at Down Island.** What confuses them? What breaks? What takes too long? This is the product feedback loop that matters most.

### Mise's Biggest Bottleneck Right Now

**Mise only works at one restaurant.**

Everything — revenue, growth, PMF signal — is blocked by this. The contractor, the security work, the multi-tenant refactor — these all serve one purpose: making Mise deployable to a second restaurant. Everything else is secondary.

### Mise's Weekly Operating Loop

1. **Primary KPI:** Active restaurants using Mise weekly (target: get from 1 to 2)
2. **Weekly growth goal:** Make measurable progress toward Down Island going live
3. **Bottleneck this week:** [Identify honestly each Monday — is it a code blocker? A security gap? An onboarding issue? A human scheduling problem?]
4. **1-2 initiatives:** Attack only the bottleneck
5. **Execute.** Don't plan more. Do the thing.
6. **Friday review:** Did the bottleneck move? If not, why? Was it actually the bottleneck, or were you avoiding something harder?
7. **Adjust Monday.** Repeat.

### The Honest Question to Ask Every Day

**"Does what I'm about to do get Mise closer to a second restaurant using it this week?"**

If yes, do it. If no, ask why you're doing it.
