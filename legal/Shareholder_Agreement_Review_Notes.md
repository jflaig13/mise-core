## Overview
Austin has prepared a comprehensive shareholder agreement establishing a **70/30 equity split** (Jon: 70%, Austin: 30%) with all shares fully vested. The agreement includes standard protective provisions and is governed by Delaware law.

## Strengths
✅ Clean 70/30 split with no vesting complications
✅ Transfer restrictions and ROFR protect both founders
✅ Co-sale rights ensure fair treatment
✅ IP assignment clearly established
✅ Delaware C-Corp structure (standard for VC funding)
✅ Both founders have signed via DocuSign

## Recommended Additions

### 1. Founder Departure Provisions
**Add a new section covering:**

```
Section X. Founder Separation

a) Voluntary Resignation ("Good Leaver"):
   - Founder may resign with 90 days' notice
   - Retains all vested equity
   - Subject to transfer restrictions and ROFR

b) Termination for Cause ("Bad Leaver"):
   - Company may repurchase shares at fair market value
   - Cause defined as: fraud, criminal conviction, material breach of duties

c) Death or Disability:
   - Shares pass to estate/designated beneficiary
   - Company has ROFR to purchase at FMV within 180 days
   - Recommend key person life insurance: $1M-$2M on each founder
```

### 2. Employee Stock Option Pool
**Add authorization language:**

```
Section Y. Equity Incentive Plan

The Corporation is authorized to adopt an Equity Incentive Plan reserving up to
1,000,000 shares (10% of authorized shares) for issuance to employees, consultants,
and advisors, subject to Board approval of the plan terms.

Pre-funding: This pool shall be established prior to the Pre-Seed Financing and
shall dilute founders pro-rata (70/30).
```

### 3. Future Financing Terms
**Add clarity on fundraising:**

```
Section Z. Future Equity Issuance

a) Pre-Seed Financing:
   - Shareholders agree that equity issued in Pre-Seed round shall dilute both
     founders pro-rata according to their ownership percentages
   - Neither shareholder has anti-dilution rights in the Pre-Seed round

b) Future Rounds:
   - Standard pro-rata dilution applies unless otherwise agreed in writing
   - Major decisions requiring Board + majority shareholder approval:
     * Issuing new equity exceeding 15% of outstanding shares
     * Incurring debt exceeding $100,000
     * Selling the company or substantially all assets
```

### 4. Decision-Making Authority
**Clarify spending limits and authority:**

```
Section AA. Management Authority

a) CEO Authority (Jonathan Flaig):
   - Day-to-day operations and management
   - Contracts and expenditures up to $25,000 per transaction
   - Hiring and termination of non-executive employees

b) Board Approval Required:
   - Expenditures exceeding $25,000 per transaction
   - Executive hires (VP level and above)
   - Annual budget approval
   - Equity grants
   - Debt financing

c) Unanimous Shareholder Approval Required:
   - Amendments to Articles of Incorporation
   - Sale or merger of the company
   - Voluntary dissolution
```

### 5. Name Correction
**Verify:** The agreement lists "Austin Miett" but he may be known as "Austin Kelley" in other contexts. Confirm legal name and ensure consistency across all documents.

## Tax Considerations

### 83(b) Election - CRITICAL
Since shares are "fully vested" as of January 22, 2026, **both founders should file an 83(b) election with the IRS within 30 days** (by February 21, 2026).

**Why this matters:**
- Without 83(b): You pay income tax on equity value as it vests (potentially at IPO/exit valuations)
- With 83(b): You pay tax NOW (on minimal/zero value) and future gains are capital gains

**Action Required:**
1. Founders should consult a tax advisor IMMEDIATELY
2. File Form 83(b) with IRS within 30 days of January 22, 2026
3. Send copies to IRS, keep copy for records, send copy to company

## Pre-Seed Financing Readiness

### What Investors Will Want to See
When you approach pre-seed investors, they'll expect:

1. **Cap Table Clarity** ✅ (You have this)
2. **Option Pool** ⚠️ (Need to establish 10-15%)
3. **Board Structure** ⚠️ (May want to add investor board seat)
4. **Standard Docs** ✅ (Bylaws and Shareholder Agreement exist)
5. **IP Assignment** ✅ (Covered in Section 8)
6. **Delaware C-Corp** ✅ (Standard and correct)

### Suggested Pre-Fundraise Actions

**Immediately (this week):**
- [ ] File 83(b) elections for both founders (within 30 days of 1/22/26)
- [ ] Verify Austin's legal name is correct in all documents
- [ ] Get D&O insurance quotes ($1M-$2M coverage)

**Before fundraising (next 1-2 months):**
- [ ] Establish employee stock option pool (10% = 1,000,000 shares)
- [ ] Add founder separation provisions to agreement
- [ ] Clarify decision-making authority limits
- [ ] Consider adding 3rd board seat for future investor

**During fundraising:**
- [ ] Investors will bring their own documents (SAFE, priced round, etc.)
- [ ] Your agreement will be amended to accommodate investor rights
- [ ] Expect to add: pro-rata rights, information rights, board observer seat

## Bottom Line Assessment

**This is a GOOD agreement.** Austin did solid work. The 70/30 split is clearly established, protective provisions are in place, and the structure is investor-friendly (Delaware C-Corp).

**Recommended next steps:**
1. ✅ **Sign as-is** if you want to move quickly (it's enforceable and protective)
2. 📋 **File 83(b) elections IMMEDIATELY** (you have ~2 weeks left of the 30-day window)
3. 🔧 **Amend later** to add the missing provisions above before you fundraise
4. ⚖️ **Have a startup attorney review** before taking money from investors (budget $2K-$5K)

The missing provisions (founder departure, option pool, etc.) are **nice to have** but not deal-breakers. You can add them via amendment before fundraising.

## Questions for Austin

1. Is your legal name "Austin Miett" or "Austin Kelley"? (Agreement shows "Miett")
2. Have you filed an 83(b) election for your shares? (Due by February 21, 2026)
3. Should we establish an employee option pool before fundraising? (Typically 10-15%)
4. Do you want to add founder separation terms now or wait?
